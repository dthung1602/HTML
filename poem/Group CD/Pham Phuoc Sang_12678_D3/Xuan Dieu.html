		Ngo Xuan Dieu, known simply as Xuan Dieu, was born on February 2, 1916, at Tuy Phuoc, Binh Dinh Province, where his father Ngo Xuan Tho,<br>
		a schoolteacher, had married his mother Nguyen Thi Hiep. For two years (1938-1940), Xuan Dieu was Huy Can's roommate at the College of <br>
		Agriculture in Hanoi, from which he received his engineering degree in agricultural science in 1943. He died on 18 December 1985.<br>
		<br>
        As a prolific poet, Xuan Dieu wrote some 450 poems, a large number of which had never been published. His representative works include a<br> 
		collection of poems in the volume "Tho Tho" (Poetry, Poetry, 1938), "Gui Huong Cho Gio" (Perfume to the Wind, 1945), "Ngon Quoc Ky"<br>
		(The National Flag, 1945), an anthology "Tuyen tap Xuan Dieu" (Xuan Dieu Anthology, 1983), a collection of short stories, "Phan Thong Vang"<br> 
		(The Yellow Pine Pollen, 1939), diaries, essays, and literary criticisms.<br>
		<br>
        Xuan Dieu embodies the New Poetry Movement in style, if not in spirit. His poetry is imbued with emotions, intense, powerful, burning,<br> 
		and replete with insatiable yearning. He treats the theme of love with highly expressive images, musicality, audacious imagination, and<br>
		sometimes biting bitterness. His most enduring legacy lies in the freshness of his poetic imagery, his intensely personal tone, the<br> 
		authenticity of his feelings that resonate among modern readers, a startling diction, and the boldness of his artistic sensibility.<br> 
		Without a doubt Xuan Dieu is a supremely romantic poet, whether or not juxtaposed to French or English romantics.<br>

		The other day you sat too far away from me<br> 
        So I asked you to move over a bit closer.<br> 
        You inched over closer, but I demurred.<br>
        To be a good girl you inched still closer.<br> 
        As I was boiling over, in haste with a smile<br> 
        You scooted closer soothing, "Here I am!"<br> 
        I brightened up then scowled at once<br>
        For I thought, you were still too far away.<br>
        <br>
        A lover's eyes, how abyss-like they really are!<br> 
        Oh high heaven, the forehead of a lover!<br>
        What do I see deep behind beauty's face<br> 
        That I grasped in my frustrated hands?<br> 
        Even with faith in one life, one dream,<br> 
        You are you, and I am still me.<br> 
        Is it possible to cross over the Great Wall<br>
        Of our two universes filled with mystery ?<br> 
        Though longing flows down the river of time<br> 
        My past, I did not share with you.<br> 
        My soul's dark recesses darker than night<br> 
        Inscrutable to me, inscrutable to all.<br> 
        Always searching, suspicious, baselessly jealous<br> 
        I want to inspect your mind in its dreams.<br> 
        But I keep my unexpected dreams from you<br> 
        Just as you keep the naked truth from me.<br>
        <br>
        Let's bring our heads together, press our breasts!<br> 
        Let our hair short and long mingle!<br>
        Our arms! Let them squeeze our shoulders!<br>
        Let our love well up in our eyes!<br> 
        Let's close our lips with a tight seal<br> 
        So I can hear the pearls of your teeth.<br> 
        Enraptured I fain say to you,<br> 
        "Come closer! You are still too far away!"<br>

        "I am deeply in love, dear, is that not enough?<br>
        "How greedy you are, and demanding too!<br>
        "You already know, for I've told you I love you.<br> 
        "Why insist on me repeating old stuff so oft?<br>
		<br>
        You love me deeply, but is that enough ?<br>
        If you are in love, but you just keep it inside<br>
        And not show it, then words are empty,<br> 
        And beauty is as cold as marble.<br>
        <br>
        I have an immense desire, did you know?<br> 
        And absolute, too. I'm in constant search of you.<br> 
        If today's truth is truth no longer tomorrow,<br> 
        How can, my dear, love ever be old too?<br>
        <br>
        Be deeply in love, but that is still not enough.<br> 
        You've got to say love, hundreds, no, thousands of times.<br> 
        Be so loving that every night is one of spring,<br>
        And birds and butterflies freed in the love garden.<br>
        <br>
        Say it, you must say it, you must.<br>
        <br>
        With words that dwell privy in your eyes and your brows<br> 
        With joy, bashfulness, and ecstasy at dusk,<br>
        With head cuddling, smile on your lips, and grasping arms,<br> 
        With wordless intensity, what else do I know !<br>
        <br>
        Just make sure you don't stay frigid as ice<br> 
        Or be unmoved beside one burning with desire,<br> 
        Nor be as placid as still water in the pond.<br> 
        Be deeply in love, but that is still not enough.<br>

	    I still remember Rimbaud and Verlaine,<br>
        The two besotted men of poetry<br>
        Drunk with exotic verse and with passion,<br>
        Defying worn paths and old ways.<br>
        <br>
        They walked in lock step on their way,<br> 
        Their souls steeped in the fragrant air;<br> 
        Weak in strong their arms enlaced fore'er;<br> 
        In all weather, singing their love song gay.<br>
        <br>
        Nothing matters, future or past,<br>
        Who wears makeup or colored dress.<br>
        Who cares about heaven or hell ?<br>
        They are simply in love; that's swell.<br>
