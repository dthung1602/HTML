		Nguyen Khuyen was a famous Vietnamese Confucian scholar, poet and teacher living in 19th century. Nguyen Khuyen was born on 15 February, 1835<br>
		in his mother-in-law hometown Van Khe village, Hoang Xa commune, Y Yen district, Nam Dinh province. His father-in-law home town is Va village<br>
		, Yen Do commune,Binh Luc district, Ha Nam province. His father who was a teacher is Nguyen Tong Khoi (1796-1853). His mother is Tran Thi Thoan<br>
		(1799-1874) whose father is Tran Cong Trac. His first teacher is Pham Van Nghi. Although his intelligence and high knowledge, his examination<br> 
		path was not in favourable condition. In 1864, he passed the "Cu nhan" degree (the lowest degree of Vietnames feudal educational system) at<br> 
		first-rate in Ha Noi. One year later, unfortunately, he failed Hoi examination that was why he lived in Hanoi to learn in Quoc Tu Giam<br>
		(National University). He continued to study. Furthermore, to remind himself in iron discipline and mobilize himself, he changed his given name<br>
		from Nguyen Thang to Nguyen Khuyen. In Vietnamese language, "Thang" only means success or victory but "Khuyen" has a stronger meaning that is<br> 
		inspiration or stimulation, "Thang" is the result but "Khuyen" is the way toward result (Vietnamese people has a good tradition named "Khuyen Hoc"<br>
		- Study Encouragement). After six years of exertion, he passed the Hoi Nguyen degree and the Dinh Nguyen degree continuously in only one year 1871.<br>
		This case has been very rare throughout history, so people gave him an honourable name:"Tam Nguyen Yen Do" (Yen Do's first-rate graduate in three times).<br>
	</p>
	<p>
        He was responsible for Mandarin in the age of French invasion. All events happened like his text in Dinh Nguyen examination twelve previous years:<br>
		"The carriage does not come toward because the horses do not want to pull as well as the political situation does not become better because people<br> 
		do not want to do. Are there no talent in life ? It is completely untrue". When patriotic movements such as "Can Vuong" ("Seeking the King") were<br>
		fired out and his dream of "Tri quoc, binh thien ha" (leading the country, pacifying the world) was not realized, he landed in an impasse. He<br>
		recognized his powerlessness of changing condition and was awarded deeply of the decline of Vietnamese feudalism. He was one of first Vietnamese<br>
		people criticizing feudalism system that is conservative and unrealistic. In 1884, he withdrew from public life and reculde himself in Yen Do as<br>
		the action showing incorporation with French enemy. This was also the time he found back the relaxation in his soul in simple and tranquil life in<br>
		countryside. The more disadvantages he met in his life, the more talented he became in his writing. He was the hyphen between classical literature<br>
		and modern literature. He was both a prominent lyric poet and an outstanding satirical poet. He reached the peak of Nom letter's literature. He was<br>
		the first Vietnamese poet who put realism opinions in classism poems. Among his best poems are: "Group of three poems about Autumn: Fishing in Autumn,<br> 
		Drinking in Autumn, Versing on Autumn" which express the sad and loneliness and "Paper Doctor" which ridicule incapable Scholars. In addition, he<br>
		was one of a little upper-class poets wrote about poor farmers in praising attitude. Reviewing all his life, he only taught his children about deep<br>
		gratitude toward farmers:<br>
		"Being Scholar, do not forget rice, beans and eggplants".<br>
        He died on 5 February, 1909 in his hometown Yen Do.<br>

		In the cold autumn pond water is glassy,<br>
		A tiny fishing boat, itsy-bitsy,<br>
		Blue water ripples slightly with drifting mist,<br>
		Golden leaves in the wind softly whizz,<br>
        In the azure sky hang cloud layers,<br>
		The winding bamboo path is empty,<br>
		This pole long hold against my knees, no catch,<br>
		Fish nip duckweed roots below maybe.<br>
