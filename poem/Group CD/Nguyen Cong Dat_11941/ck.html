		Hear my prayer, O heavenly Father,<br>
		Ere I lay me down to sleep;<br>
		Bid Thy angels, pure and holy,<br>
		Round my bed their vigil keep.<br>
	<br>
		My sins are heavy, but Thy mercy<br>
		Far outweighs them, every one;<br>
		Down before Thy cross I cast them,<br>
		Trusting in Thy help alone.<br>
	<br>
		Keep me through this night of peril<br>
		Underneath its boundless shade;<br>
		Take me to Thy rest, I pray Thee,<br>
		When my pilgrimage is made.<br>
	<br>
		None shall measure out Thy patience<br>
		By the span of human thought;<br>
		None shall bound the tender mercies<br>
		Which Thy Holy Son has bought.<br>
	<br>
		Pardon all my past transgressions,<br>
		Give me strength for days to come;<br>
		Guide and guard me with Thy blessing<br>
		Till Thy angels bid me home. <br>

		How beautiful at eventide<br>
		To see the twilight shadows pale,<br>
		Steal o'er the landscape, far and wide,<br>
		O'er stream and meadow, mound and dale!<br>
	<br>
		How soft is Nature's calm repose<br>
		When evening skies their cool dews weep:<br>
		The gentlest wind more gently blows,<br>
		As if to soothe her in her sleep!<br>
	<br>	
		The gay morn breaks,<br>
		Mists roll away,<br>
		All Nature awakes<br>
		To glorious day.<br>
		In my breast alone<br>
		Dark shadows remain;<br>
		The peace it has known<br>
		It can never regain.<br>

		Oh, a dainty plant is the Ivy green,<br>
		That creepeth o'er ruins old!<br>
		Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,<br>
		In his cell so lone and cold.<br>
		The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed,<br>
		To pleasure his dainty whim:<br>
		And the mouldering dust that years have made<br>
		Is a merry meal for him.<br>
		Creeping where no life is seen,<br>
		A rare old plant is the Ivy green.<br>
	<br>
		Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings,<br>
		And a staunch old heart has he.<br>
		How closely he twineth, how tight he clings<br>
		To his friend the huge Oak Tree!<br>
		And slyly he traileth along the ground,<br>
		And his leaves he gently waves,<br>
		As he joyously hugs and crawleth round<br>
		The rich mould of dead men's graves.<br>
		Creeping where grim death hath been,<br>
		A rare old plant is the Ivy green.<br>
	<br>
		Whole ages have fled and their works decayed,<br>
		And nations have scattered been;<br>
		But the stout old Ivy shall never fade,<br>
		From its hale and hearty green.<br>
		The brave old plant, in its lonely days,<br>
		Shall fatten upon the past:<br>
		For the stateliest building man can raise<br>
		Is the Ivy's food at last.<br>
		Creeping on where time has been,<br>
		A rare old plant is the Ivy green.<br>
