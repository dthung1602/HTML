	<h2 align="center">Charles Dickens</h2>
	<pre>
		<br>
	Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an 
	English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known 
	fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era.
	His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth 
	century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and 
	short stories enjoy lasting popularity.
	Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age.His 1843 novella, A Christmas
	Carol, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. 
	Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted, and, like many of his 
	novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, 
	set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens's creative
	genius has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. 
	Chesterton—for its realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social 
	criticism. On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained 
	of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism. 
	The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his 
	writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.

	<h2 align="center"> William Shakespeare</h2>
	<pre>
	<br>
	William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616)was an English poet, 
	playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language
	and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.He is often called England's national poet, 
	and the "Bard of Avon".His extant works, including collaborations, consist of 
	approximately 38 plays,154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, 
	some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living 
	language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
	Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during 
	his lifetime. In 1623, however, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow
	actors of Shakespeare, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, 
	a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the 
	plays now recognised as Shakespeare's.It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in
	which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as "not of an age, but for all time".
