    <p align="justify"> <font size="+3">G</font>raduating from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in 2006, Adele was given a recording contract by XL Recordings after a friend posted her demo on Myspace the same year. In 2007, she received the Brit Awards "Critics' Choice" award and won the BBC Sound of 2008 poll. Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It is certified seven times platinum in the UK, and three times platinum in the US. An appearance she made on Saturday Night Live in late 2008 boosted her career in the US. At the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009, Adele received the awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.</p>

    <p align="justify"><font size="+2">A</font>dele released her second studio album, 21, in early 2011. The album was well received critically and surpassed the success of her debut, earning the singer numerous awards in 2012, among them a record-tying six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year; two Brit Awards, including British Album of the Year, and three American Music Awards. The album has been certified 16 times platinum in the UK, and is the fourth best-selling album in the UK of all time. In the US it has held the top position longer than any album since 1985, and is certified Diamond. The album has sold 31 million copies worldwide.</p>

    <p align="justify"><font size="+2">T</font>he success of 21 earned Adele numerous mentions in the Guinness Book of World Records. She is the first woman in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 to have three simultaneous top 10 singles as a lead artist, and the first female artist to simultaneously have two albums in the top five of the Billboard 200 and two singles in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100. 21 is the longest-running number one album by a female solo artist in the history of the UK and US Album Charts. In 2012, she released "Skyfall", which she wrote and recorded for the James Bond film of the same name. The song won an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. After taking a three-year break, Adele released her third studio album, 25, in 2015. It became the year's best-selling album and broke first week sales records in the UK and US. 25 was her second album to be certified Diamond in the US. The lead single, "Hello", became the first song in the US to sell over one million digital copies within a week of its release.</p>

    <p align="justify"><font size="+2">I</font>n 2011 and 2012, Billboard named Adele Artist of the Year. In 2012, she was listed at number five on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music. Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world in 2012 and 2016. With sales of more than 100 million records, Adele is one of the best-selling recording artists in the world.</p>

 Hello, it's me
 I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
 To go over everything
 They say that time's supposed to heal ya
 But I ain't done much healing
 
 Hello, can you hear me?
 I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
 When we were younger and free
 I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
 
 There's such a difference between us
 And a million miles
 
 Hello from the other side
 I must have called a thousand times
 To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
 But when I call you never seem to be home
 Hello from the outside
 At least I can say that I've tried
 To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
 But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
 
 Hello, how are you?
 It's so typical of me to talk about myself. I'm sorry
 I hope that you're well
 Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
 
 And it's no secret that the both of us
 Are running out of time
 
 So hello from the other side (other side)
 I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
 To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
 But when I call you never seem to be home
 Hello from the outside (outside)
 At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
 To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
 But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
 
 [4x:]
 (Highs, highs, highs, highs,
 Lows, lows, lows, lows)
 Anymore
 
 Hello from the other side (other side)
 I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
 To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
 But when I call you never seem to be home
 Hello from the outside (outside)
 At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
 To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
 But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

 There's a fire burning in my heart
 Reaching a fever pitch
 And it's bringing me out of the dark
 Finally I can see you crystal clear
 Go 'head and sell me out
 And I'll lay your ship bare
 See how I will leave with every part of you
 Don't underestimate the things that I will do
 There's a fire burning in my heart
 Reaching a fever pitch
 And it's bringing me out of the dark
 
 The scars of your love remind me of us
 It keeps me thinking we almost had it all
 The scars of your love, it keeps me breathless
 I can't help thinking
 
 We could have had it all
 (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
 Rolling in the deep
 (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 You had my heart inside of your hand
 (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
 But you played it, to the beat
 (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 
 Baby, I have
 No story to be told
 But I've heard one on you
 And I'm gonna make your head burn
 Think of me
 In the depths of your despair
 Make a home down there
 As mine sure won't be shared
 
 The scars of your love remind me of us
 It keeps me thinking we almost had it all
 The scars of your love keep me breathless
 I can't help thinking
 
 We could have had it all
 (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
 Rolling in the deep
 (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 You had my heart inside of your hand
 (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
 Yeah, but you played this to the beat
 (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 
 We could have had it all
 (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
 Rolling in the deep
 (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 You had my heart inside of your hand, boy
 (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
 Ah, but you played this to the beat
 (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 To the beat, beat, beat, beat
 
 Throw your soul through every open door
 Count your blessings to find what you look for
 Turn my sorrow into treasure gold
 You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
 
 (You know that there ain't no mountain high enough)
 I'm still in love with you, oh, boy
 (Ain't no valley low enough)
 You're one and only, you are my heart
 (Ain't no river wide enough)
 (To keep me from getting to you)
 There ain't no my mountain, it ain't no, yeah, yeah
 
 (You know that there ain't no mountain high enough)
 There ain't no mountain high enough
 (Ain't no valley low enough)
 If you go to trouble
 (Ain't no river wide enough)
 I'll be there, oh, baby
 (To keep me from getting to you, babe)
 Yes I will
 
 We could have had it all
 Rolling in the deep
 You had my heart inside of your hand, bro
 But you played this to the beat
 (Rolling in the deep)
 
 We could have had it all
 (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
 Honey, honey, honey, yeah, yeah
 (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 I'm still in love with you, yeah, I'm trying
 (You're gonna wish you, rolling in the deep)
 Oh yeah, oh yeah

 I let it fall, my heart,
 And as it fell you rose to claim it
 It was dark and I was over
 Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
 
 My hands, they're strong
 But my knees were far too weak,
 To stand in your arms
 Without falling to your feet
 
 But there's a side to you
 That I never knew, never knew.
 All the things you'd say
 They were never true, never true,
 And the games you play
 You would always win, always win.
 
 But I set fire to the rain,
 Watched it pour as I touched your face,
 Well, it burned while I cried
 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
 
 When I lay with you
 I could stay there
 Close my eyes
 Feel you here forever
 You and me together
 Nothing gets better
 
 But there's a side to you
 That I never knew, never knew,
 All the things you'd say,
 They were never true, never true,
 And the games you'd play
 You would always win, always win.
 
 But I set fire to the rain,
 Watched it pour as I touched your face,
 Well, it burned while I cried
 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
 
 I set fire to the rain
 And I threw us into the flames
 When it fell, something died
 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, last time!
 
 Sometimes I wake up by the door,
 And heart you caught must be waiting for you
 Even that when we're already over
 I can't help myself from looking for you.
 
 I set fire to the rain,
 Watched it pour as I touched your face,
 Well, it burned while I cried
 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
 
 I set fire to the rain,
 And I threw us into the flames
 When it fell, something died
 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, ohhhh!
 
 Oh noooo
