		<p align="left">Come up from the fields father, here’s a letter from our Pete,<br>
And come to the front door mother, here’s a letter from thy dear son. <br><br>

Lo, ’tis autumn, <br>
Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder, <br>
Cool and sweeten Ohio’s villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind, <br>
Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis’d vines,   <br>
(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines? <br>
Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?) <br><br>

Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with wondrous clouds,   <br>
Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well. <br><br>

Down in the fields all prospers well, <br>
But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter’s call, <br>
And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away. <br><br>

Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling, <br>
She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.<br><br>
Open the envelope quickly, <br>  
O this is not our son’s writing, yet his name is sign’d, <br>
O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother’s soul! <br>
All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main words only, <br>
Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken to hospital, <br>
At present low, but will soon be better. <br><br></p> 
				</font>

			<p align="left">

Ah now the single figure to me, <br>
Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms, <br>
Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint, <br>
By the jamb of a door leans. <br><br>

Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through her sobs, <br>
The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay’d,) <br>
See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better. <br>
Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be better, that brave and simple soul,) <br>
While they stand at home at the door he is dead already, <br>
The only son is dead. <br><br>

But the mother needs to be better, <br>
She with thin form presently drest in black, <br>
By day her meals untouch’d, then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking, <br>
In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,   <br>
O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and withdraw, <br>
To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.<br></p></font>
