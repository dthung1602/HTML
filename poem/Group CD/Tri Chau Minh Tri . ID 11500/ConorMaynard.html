This song was written and published on his Youtube channel in September 2016 . Just within a day, the song already had more than 1 milion views. This song is about a man after a break-up. In my opinion, this has to be his most sucessful song. However, since he doesn't have a recording contract so his work is not known globally.

Four in the morning, staring at the ceiling<br>
On my own, like I was last weekend<br>
You left and I guess you had your reasons<br>
Guess you had your reasons, yeah<br>
I said things and I didn't really mean them<br>
Kept going till I saw your heart bleeding<br>
Ruining the only thing I ever believed in<br>
Ever believed in, yeah<br>

And even though you're gone<br>
I'm gonna pretend there's nothing wrong<br>
I'm fucking every girl that comes along<br>
Anything is better than to face up to reality, oh oh<br>

This is my version of heartbreak<br>
This is how I get over you<br>
I don't wanna feel<br>
I don't wanna feel<br>
This is my version of heartbreak<br>
And it's all I know how to do<br>
I don't wanna feel like this anymore<br>
This is my version of a heartbreak<br>

Clothes on the floor, yeah and the beds all mine<br>
And staying out 'till the sun starts rising<br>
Free as a bird but I'm still not flying<br>
God, I'm trying, yeah<br>

And even though you're gone<br>
I'm telling everyone there's nothing wrong<br>
Until I can believe you're not the one<br>
Anything is better than to face up to reality, oh oh<br>

This is my version of heartbreak<br>
This is how I get over you<br>
I don't wanna feel<br>
I don't wanna feel<br>
This is my version of heartbreak<br>
And it's all I know how to do<br>
I don't wanna feel like this anymore<br>
This is my version of a heartbreak<br>
This is my version of a heartbreak<br>
This is my version of a heartbreak <br>

That there, let me break it off<br>
All the pressure that you got, let me take it off<br>
I swear, we're gonna make it hot<br>
Put your hands in the air, don't stop<br>
I'll knock you down like you're Keri<br>
Forget your name like Rihanna<br>
You can run the world, Queen B<br>
Be unthinkable, Alicia<br>
We can go so far if she let go<br>
And I ain't gonna leave without her<br>

[Chorus:]<br>
This is for the girl that can get down low<br>
The whole club wanna see you go<br>
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl<br>
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl<br>
Bass coming down so hard<br>
That little dress breaking every heart<br>
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl<br>
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl<br>

Like a Vegas girl<br>

Roll the dice, I've got your number<br>
Hit the jackpot underneath the cover<br>
Intoxicated, you're like a drug, girl<br>
Grab a glass, gonna rain tequila<br>
I'll knock you down like you're Keri<br>
Forget your name like Rihanna<br>
You can run the world, Queen B<br>
Be unthinkable, Alicia<br>
We can go so far if she let go<br>
And I ain't gonna leave without her<br>

[Chorus:]<br>
This is for the girl that can get down low<br>
The whole club wanna see you go<br>
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl<br>
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl<br>
Bass coming down so hard<br>
That little dress breaking every heart<br>
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl<br>
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl<br>

Like a Vegas girl<br>

It feels so right every night<br>
Like you're in Vegas, girl<br>
(Like a Vegas girl) in Vegas, girl [x4]<br>

[Chorus:]<br>
This is for the girl that can get down low<br>
The whole club wanna see you go<br>
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl<br>
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl<br>
Bass coming down so hard<br>
That little dress breaking every heart<br>
Ey, shake, shake like you're famous, girl<br>
Head back, lay it down like a Vegas girl<br>
