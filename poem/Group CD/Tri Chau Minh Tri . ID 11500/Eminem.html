Just gonna stand there and watch me burn<br>
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts<br>
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry<br>
But that's alright because I love the way you lie<br>
I love the way you lie<br>
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like<br>
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe<br>
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight<br>
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight<br>
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint<br>
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate<br>
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates<br>
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait<br>
Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't<br>
Come back, we're running right back here we go again<br>
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great<br>
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane<br>
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed<br>
I snapped "who's that dude?", I don't even know his name<br>
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again<br>
I guess I don't know my own strength<br>
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn<br>
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts<br>
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry<br>
But that's alright because I love the way you lie<br>
I love the way you lie<br>
I love the way you lie<br>
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em<br>
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em<br>
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em<br>
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em<br>
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em<br>
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em<br>
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em<br>
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em<br>
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both<br>
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya<br>
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over<br>
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over<br>
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint<br>
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game<br>
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window<br>
Guess that's why they call it window pane<br>
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn<br>
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts<br>
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry<br>
But that's alright because I love the way you lie<br>
I love the way you lie<br>
I love the way you lie<br>
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean<br>
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine<br>
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me<br>
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please<br>
Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me<br>
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems<br>
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano<br>
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though<br>
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk<br>
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk<br>
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball<br>
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall<br>
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize<br>
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games<br>
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar<br>
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire<br>
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn<br>
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts<br>
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry<br>
But that's alright because I love the way you lie<br>
I love the way you lie<br>
I love the way you lie<br>

The song was written by Skylar Grey and  produced by British record producer Alex da Kid,[1] mixed by Dr. Dre, and was released for digital download through the American iTunes Store on February 1, 2011.Musically, "I Need a Doctor" is predominantly a rap song, backed by a "spacey", drum-heavy production, with extra piano keys featured in the introduction and the chorus. Lyrically, the song is largely about Dr. Dre and Eminem's close friendship, and how they have often needed and inspired each other in the past.
Even though the song was leaked onto the Internet several months in advance of its release, it became a significant commercial success on its official release, particularly in the United States, where it peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Dr. Dre's second highest peaking song on the chart ever, and also peaking in the upper regions of many national charts.

I'm about to lose my mind<br>
you've been gone for so long<br>
I'm running out of time<br>
I need a doctor<br>
call me a doctor<br>
I need a doctor, doctor<br>
to bring me back to life<br>

[Eminem]<br>
I told the world one day I would pay it back<br>
say it on tape, and lay it, record it<br>
so that one day I could play it back<br>
but I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that<br>
ya'll starting to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black<br>
Hope - I just need a ray of that<br>
'Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for 'em<br>
They just say it's wack<br>
they don't know what dope is<br>
and I don't know if I was awake or asleep<br>
when I wrote this,<br>
all I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest<br>
you picked me up, breathing life in me<br>
I owe my life to you<br>
but for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do<br>
but it just dawned on me you lost a son<br>
daemons fighting you, it's dark.<br>
let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you<br>
I don't think you realize what you mean to me<br>
not the slightest clue<br>
'Cause me and you were like a crew<br>
I was like your sidekick<br>
you gon either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic<br>
or you gon hug me<br>
But I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do 'cause<br>

[Chorus - Skylar Grey]<br>
I'm about to lose my mind<br>
you've been gone for so long<br>
I'm running out of time<br>
I need a doctor<br>
call me a doctor<br>
I need a doctor, doctor<br>
to bring me back to life<br>

[Eminem]<br>
It hurts when I see you struggle<br>
you come to me with ideas<br>
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled<br>
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy<br>
But you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more<br>
seems like your own opinion's not one you can form<br>
Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself<br>
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help<br>
like I'm your leader<br>
your supposed to fucking be my mentor<br>
I can endure no more,<br>
I demand you remember who you are<br>
it was you who believed in me<br>
when everyone was telling you don't sign me<br>
Everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth<br>
you risked your career for me<br>
I know it as well as you<br>
nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy<br>
Dre, I'm crying in this booth<br>
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours<br>
but I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more<br>
but I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me<br>
Get up Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake 'cause<br>

[Chorus - Skylar Grey]<br>
I'm about to lose my mind<br>
you've been gone for so long<br>
I'm running out of time<br>
I need a doctor<br>
call me a doctor<br>
I need a doctor, doctor<br>
to bring me back to life<br>
bring me back to life<br>
bring me back to life<br>

(I need a doctor, doctor<br>
to bring me back to life)<br>

[Dr Dre]<br>
It literally feels like a lifetime ago<br>
but I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though<br>
you walked in, yellow jump suit<br>
whole room, cracked jokes<br>
once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke<br>
went through friends, some of them I put on<br>
but they just left, they said they was riding to the death<br>
But where the fuck are they now?<br>
now that I need them, I don't see none of them<br>
all I see is Slim<br>
fuck all you fair-weather friends<br>
all I need is him<br>
fucking backstabbers
when the chips were down you just laughed at us<br>
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots<br>
you gon see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?<br>
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots, and the cracker's ass<br>
Little Cracker Jack, beat-making wackass backwards producers<br>
I'm back, bastards<br>
one more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving<br>
I'll guarantee they scream, Dre don't leave us like that man 'cause<br>

[Chorus - Skylar Grey]<br>
I'm about to lose my mind<br>
you've been gone for so long<br>
I'm running out of time<br>
I need a doctor<br>
call me a doctor<br>
I need a doctor, doctor<br>
to bring me back to life<br>

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed<br>
Get along with the voices inside of my head<br>
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath<br>
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy<br>

[Verse 1: Eminem]<br>
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek<br>
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey<br>
Wanted to receive attention for my music<br>
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me<br>
Been wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways<br>
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated<br>
When I blew; see, it was confusing<br>
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf<br>
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)<br>
Hit the lottery, oh wee<br>
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet<br>
With this like winning a huge meet<br>
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink<br>
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep<br>
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith<br>
But I'm actually weirder than you think<br>
Cause I'm<br>

[Hook]<br>

[Bridge: Rihanna]<br>
Well, that's nothing<br>
Well, that's nothing<br>

[Verse 2: Eminem]<br>
No, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me<br>
To seize the moment and don't squander it<br>
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow<br>
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from<br>
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this?<br>
No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders)<br>
Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo<br>
I think you've been wandering off down yonder<br>
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen<br>
Cause I need an interventionist<br>
To intervene between me and this monster<br>
And save me from myself and all this conflict<br>
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it<br>
My OCD is conking me in the head<br>
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking<br>
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying<br>
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the<br>

[Hook + Bridge]<br>

[Verse 3: Eminem]<br>
Call me crazy, but I have this vision<br>
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian<br>
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at<br>
Emcees, blood get spilled and I<br>
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track<br>
Give every kid who got played at<br>
Pumped up feeling and *** to say back<br>
To the kids who played 'em<br>
I ain't here to save the *** children<br>
But if one kid out of a hundred million<br>
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates that's great<br>
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back<br>
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that<br>
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack<br>
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts<br>
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that<br>
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the<br>
