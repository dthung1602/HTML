No clouds in my stones<br>
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank<br>
Coming down with the Dow Jones<br>
When the clouds come we gone, we Rocafella<br>
We fly higher than weather<br>
In G5's are better, You know me,<br>
In anticipation, for precipitation. Stack chips for the rainy day<br>
Jay, Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine<br>

You have my heart<br>
And we'll never be worlds apart<br>
May be in magazines<br>
But you'll still be my star<br>
Baby cause in the dark<br>
You can't see shiny cars<br>
And that's when you need me there<br>
With you I'll always share<br>
Because<br>

[Chorus]<br>
When the sun shines, we'll shine together<br>
Told you I'll be here forever<br>
Said I'll always be a friend<br>
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end<br>
Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
Know that we'll still have each other<br>
You can stand under my umbrella<br>
You can stand under my umbrella<br>

Under my umbrella<br>

These fancy things, will never come in between<br>
You're part of my entity, here for Infinity<br>
When the war has took it's part<br>
When the world has dealt it's cards<br>
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart<br>
Because<br>

[Chorus]<br>
When the sun shines, we'll shine together<br>
Told you I'll be here forever<br>
Said I'll always be a friend<br>
Took an oath I'ma stick it out till the end<br>
Now that it's raining more than ever<br>

Come here to me<br>
There's no distance in between our love<br>
So go on and let the rain pour<br>
I'll be all you need and more<br>
Because<br>

"California King Bed" is a song by Barbadian singer Rihanna from her fifth studio album, Loud (2010). The song was written and produced by Andrew Harr and Jermaine Jackson, of the American production duo The Runners, with Priscilla Renea and Alex Delicata. The song was chosen to be a single from the album through Twitter, and it was released as the album's sixth single on May 13, 2011, by Def Jam. "California King Bed" is a rock and R&B power ballad that lyrically discusses "the waking death of a relationship", where Rihanna asks her lover if he loves her with emotional weakness. Rihanna's vocals were commended by critics.
Commercially, the song topped the Polish and Slovakian charts, achieved the top-five in Australia, Austria, Czech Republic and Portugal, while also reaching the top-ten in Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and others. In the United States, it reached the top-forty on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and topped the Dance Club Songs. The accompanying music video for the track was directed by Rihanna's longtime collaborator and director Anthony Mandler. Its tropical and romantic setting features an eighteen foot long bed designed specifically for the video. Rihanna promoted the track with live performances at the ACM Awards, along with Sugarland front woman Jennifer Nettles, as well as on American Idol, NBC's Today show, and on her Loud Tour (2011).

Chest to chest<br> 
Nose to nose<br>  
Palm to palm<br>  
We were always just that close<br>  
Wrist to wrist<br>  
Toe to toe<br>  
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose<br>  
So how come when I reach out my finger<br>  
It feels like more than distance between us<br>  

In this california king bed<br>  
Were 10000 miles apart<br>  
I'll be california wishing on the stars<br>  
For youre heart on me<br>  
My californa king<br> 

Eye to eye<br>  
Cheek to cheek<br>  
Side by side<br>  
You were sleeping next to me<br>  
Arm in arm<br>  
Dusk to dawn <br> 
With the curtains drawn <br> 
And a little last night on these sheets<br>  
So how come when I reach out my finger <br> 
It feels like more than distance between us <br> 

In this california king bed <br> 
We're ten thousand miles apart <br> 
I bet california wishing on the stars<br>  
Warmed your heart for me <br> 
My california king <br> 

Just when I felt like giving up on us<br>  
You turned around and gave me one last touch<br>  
That made everything feel better <br> 
And even then my eyes got wetter <br> 
So confused wanna ask you if you love me<br>  
But I don't wanna feel so weak <br> 
Maybe ive been California dreaming <br> 

In this california king bed<br>  
We're ten thousand miles apart <br> 
I bet california wishing on these stars<br>  
Warmed your heart for me <br> 
My california king <br> 

My California King<br>  

In this california king bed<br>  
We're ten thousand miles apart <br> 
I bet California wishing on these stars<br> 
Warmed your heart for me <br> 
My California king<br>

"Diamonds" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna for her seventh studio album, Unapologetic (2012). It was written by Sia Furler together with its producers, Benny Blanco and StarGate. The song premiered on September 26, 2012, during the Elvis Duran and the Morning Show and was digitally released the following day as the lead single from Unapologetic. Def Jam Recordings serviced the single to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 2. "Diamonds" is a mid-tempo electronic and pop ballad that features heavy synthesizers, orchestral sounds and electronic rhythms. The song's lyrics serve as a departure from the themes of unhealthy relationships that were on Rihanna's previous singles and contain a prominent concept of love.
"Diamonds" topped music charts in over twenty countries, including the United States, where it became Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and tied her with Madonna and The Supremes for the fifth-most number one singles in the chart's history. "Diamonds" was certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and sold over 3.5 million digital copies in the country. By May 2013, it had sold over 7.5 million copies worldwide and became one of the best-selling singles of all-time.

Shine bright like a diamond<br>
Shine bright like a diamond<br>

Find light in the beautiful sea<br>
I choose to be happy<br>
You and I, you and I<br>
We’re like diamonds in the sky<br>

You’re a shooting star I see<br>
A vision of ecstasy<br>
When you hold me, I’m alive<br>
We’re like diamonds in the sky<br>

I knew that we’d become one right away<br>
Oh, right away<br>
At first sight I left the energy of sun rays<br>
I saw the life inside your eyes<br>

So shine bright, tonight you and I<br>
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br>
Eye to eye, so alive<br>
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br>

Shine bright like a diamond<br>
Shining bright like a diamond<br>
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br>

Palms rise to the universe<br>
As we moonshine and molly<br>
Feel the warmth, we’ll never die<br>
We’re like diamonds in the sky<br>

You’re a shooting star I see<br>
A vision of ecstasy<br>
When you hold me, I’m alive<br>
We’re like diamonds in the sky<br>

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays<br>
I saw the life inside your eyes<br>

So shine bright, tonight you and I<br>
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br>
Eye to eye, so alive<br>
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br>
