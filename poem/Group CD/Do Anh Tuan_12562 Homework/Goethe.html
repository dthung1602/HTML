<p>He was born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1749. Goethe had a thoroughly classical education before entering Leipzig University in 1765. Though he was there to study law, Goethe earned accolades for his poetry, and completed his first love poems collection, Annette. Goethe suffered a severe lung infection and spent nearly a year and half convalescing, during which time he wrote the Leipzig Songbook,  a series of ten poems set to melodies. One of his most famous works, the loosely autobiographical The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774), also dates from this period.
In 1775, Goethe joined the royal Weimar court, where he spent nearly a decade committed to scientific and metaphysical studies. Goethe continued to find inspiration in his surroundings. During the French Revolution, he was ousted from his home after the French army attacked Prussia. 
Torn between his support of democracy and his unwillingness to part with his bourgeois lifestyle, Goethe wrote Hermann and Dorothea (1797), an epic poem that examines the contrast between chaos and the complacent peace that accompanies a decadent lifestyle. Goethe is most well known for his epic poem Faust (1808), based on the legend popularized by Christopher Marlowe’s play Doctor Faustus.Goethe had a profound impact on later literary movements, including Romanticism and expressionism,and made important contributions to philosophical and naturalist schools of thought.
In 1832, Goethe died in Weimar of apparent heart failure. He is buried in the Ducal Vault at Weimar's Historical Cemetery.</p>
