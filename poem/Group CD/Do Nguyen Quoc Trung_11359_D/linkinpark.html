		<p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory(2000), which was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1.In 2014, the band was declared as the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now by Kerrang!. <br> <br>
Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora,the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year.The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronicsounds and beats. Their fifth album, Living Things (2012), combines musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth and most recent album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others on the remix albums Reanimationand Recharged.Linkin Park has sold over 68 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.

			It starts with one thing I don't know why 
			It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
			Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme 
			To explain in due time 

			All I know time is a valuable thing 
			Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
			Watch it count down to the end of the day 
			The clock ticks life away 

			It's so unreal, didn't look out below 
			Watch the time go right out the window 
			Trying to hold on but didn't even know 
			Wasted it all just to watch you go 

			I kept everything inside 
			And even though I tried, it all fell apart 
			What it meant to me 
			Will eventually be a memory of a time when 

			I tried so hard and got so far 
			But in the end it doesn't even matter 
			I had to fall to lose it all 
			But in the end it doesn't even matter 

			One thing, I don't know why 
			It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
			Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme 
			To remind myself how I tried so hard 

			In spite of the way you were mocking me 
			Acting like I was part of your property 
			Remembering all the times you fought with me 
			I'm surprised it got so far 

			Things aren't the way they were before 
			You wouldn't even recognize me anymore 
			Not that you knew me back then 
			But it all comes back to me in the end 

			You kept everything inside 
			And even though I tried, it all fell apart 
			What it meant to me 
			Will eventually be a memory of a time when 

			I tried so hard and got so far 
			But in the end it doesn't even matter 
			I had to fall to lose it all 
			But in the end it doesn't even matter 

			I've put my trust in you 
			Pushed as far as I can go 
			For all this 
			There's only one thing you should know 

			I've put my trust in you 
			Pushed as far as I can go 
			For all this 
			There's only one thing you should know 

			I tried so hard and got so far 
			But in the end it doesn't even matter 
			I had to fall to lose it all 
			But in the end it doesn't even matter

		<pre>
			I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
			Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface 
			I don't know what you're expecting of me 
			Put under the pressure, of walking in your shoes 
			(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 
			Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
			(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 

			I've become so numb 
			I can't feel you there 
			Become so tired, so much more aware 
			I'm becoming this, all I want to do 
			Is be more like me and be less like you 

			Can't you see that you're smothering me? 
			Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control 
			'Cause everything that you thought I would be 
			Has fallen apart, right in front of you 
			(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 
			Every step that I take is another mistake to you 

			(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) 
			An' every second I waste is more than I can take 

			I've become so numb 
			I can't feel you there 
			Become so tired, so much more aware 
			I'm becoming this, all I want to do 
			Is be more like me and be less like you 

			And I know 
			I may end up failing too 
			But I know 
			You were just like me 
			With someone disappointed in you 
 
			I've become so numb 
			I can't feel you there 
			Become so tired, so much more aware 
			I'm becoming this, all I want to do 
			Is be more like me and be less like you 

			I've 
			Become so numb 
			I can't feel you there 
			I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
			I've become so numb 
			I can't feel you there 
			I'm tired of being what you want me to be

		<pre>
			I remembered black skies
			The lightning all around me
			I remembered each flash
			As time began to blur
			Like a startling sign
			That fate had finally found me
			And your voice was all I heard
			That I get what I deserve

			So give me reason
			To prove me wrong
			To wash this memory clean
			Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
			Give me reason
			To fill this hole
			Connect the space between
			Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
			Across this new divide

			There was nothing in sight
			But memories left abandoned
			There was nowhere to hide
			The ashes fell like snow
			And the ground caved in
			Between where we were standing
			And your voice was all I heard
			That I get what I deserve

			So give me reason
			To prove me wrong
			To wash this memory clean
			Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
			Across this new divide

			In every loss
			In every lie
			In every truth that you'd deny
			And each regret
			And each goodbye
			Was a mistake too great to hide
			And your voice was all I heard
			That I get what I deserve

			So give me reason
			To prove me wrong
			To wash this memory clean
			Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
			Give me reason
			To fill this hole
			Connect the space between
			Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
			Across this new divide
			Across this new divide
			Across this new divide
