			So this is what you meant
			When you said that you were spent
			And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top
			Don't hold back
			Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check

			I don't ever want to let you down
			I don't ever want to leave this town
			Cause after all
			This city never sleeps at night

			It's time to begin, isn't it?
			I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
			I'm just the same as I was
			Now don't you understand
			I'm never changing who I am

			So this is where you fell
			And I am left to sell
			The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
			Don't look back
			Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check

			I don't ever want to let you down
			I don't ever want to leave this town
			Cause after all
			This city never sleeps at night

			It's time to begin, isn't it?
			I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
			I'm just the same as I was
			Now don't you understand
			I'm never changing who I am

			It's time to begin, isn't it?
			I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
			I'm just the same as I was
			Now don't you understand
			I'm never changing who I am

			This road never looked so lonely
			This house doesn't burn down slowly
			To ashes
			To ashes

			It's time to begin, isn't it?
			I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
			I'm just the same as I was
			Now don't you understand
			I'm never changing who I am

			It's time to begin, isn't it?
			I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
			I'm just the same as I was
			Now don't you understand
			I'm never changing who I am

		<pre>
		When the days are cold
		And the cards all fold
		And the saints we see
		Are all made of gold1

		When your dreams all fail
		And the ones we hail
		Are the worst of all
		And the blood's run stale

		I wanna hide the truth
		I wanna shelter you
		But with the beast inside
		There's nowhere we can hide

		No matter what we breed
		We still are made of greed
		This is my kingdom come
		This is my kingdom come

		When you feel my heat
		Look into my eyes
		It's where my demons hide
		It's where my demons hide

		Don't get too close
		It's dark inside
		It's where my demons hide
		It's where my demons hide

		At the curtains call
		It's the last of all
		When the lights fade out
		All the sinners crawl

		So they dug your grave
		And the masquerade
		Will come calling out
		At the mess you've made

		Don't wanna let you down
		But I am, hell bound
		Though this is all for you
		Don't wanna hide the truth

		No matter what we breed
		We still are made of greed
		This is my kingdom come
		This is my kingdom come

		When you feel my heat
		Look into my eyes
		It's where my demons hide
		It's where my demons hide

		Don't get too close
		It's dark inside
		It's where my demons hide
		It's where my demons hide

		They say it's what you make
		I say it's up to fate
		It's woven in my soul
		I need to let you go

		Your eyes, they shine so bright
		I wanna save that light
		I can't escape this now
		Unless you show me how

		When you feel my heat
		Look into my eyes
		It's where my demons hide
		It's where my demons hide

		Don't get too close
		It's dark inside
		It's where my demons hide
		It's where my demons hide

			I'm waking up to ash and dust
			I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
			I'm breathing in the chemicals

			I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
			This is it, the apocalypse
			Whoa

			I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
			Enough to make my systems blow
			Welcome to the new age, to the new age

			Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive

			I raise my flags, don my clothes
			It's a revolution, I suppose
			We're painted red to fit right in
			Whoa
