			Can anybody hear me? 
			Am I talking to myself? 
			My mind is running empty 
			In the search for someone else 
			Who doesn't look right through me. 
			It's all just static in my head 
			Can anybody tell me why I'm lonely like a satellite? 

			'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut 
			Sending SOS from this tiny box 
			And I lost all signal when I lifted up 
			Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot 
			Can I please come down, cause I'm tired of drifting round and round 
			Can I please come down? 

			I'm deaf from all the silence 
			Is it something that I've done? 
			I know that there are millions 
			I can't be the only one who's so disconnected 
			It's so different in my head. 
			Can anybody tell me why I'm lonely like a satellite? 

			'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut 
			Sending SOS from this tiny box 
			And I lost all signal when I lifted up 
			Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot 
			Can I please come down, cause I'm tired of drifting round and round 
			Can I please come down? 

			Now I lie awake and scream in a zero gravity 
			And it's starting to weigh down on me. 
			Let's abort this mission now 
			Can I please come down? 

			So tonight I'm calling all astronauts 
			Calling lonely people that the world forgot 
			If you hear my voice come pick me up 
			Are you out there? 
			'Cause you're all I've got! 

			'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut 
			Sending SOS from this tiny box 
			And I lost all signal when I lifted up 
			Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot 

			'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut 
			Sending SOS from this tiny box 
			To the lonely people that the world forgot 
			Are you out there? 
			'Cause you're all I've got! 

			Can I please come down? 
			'Cause I'm tired of drifting round and round. 
			Can I please come down? [x3]

		What time is it where you are? 
		I miss you more than anything 
		Back at home you feel so far 
		Waitin for the phone to ring 
		It's gettin lonely livin upside down 
		I don't even wanna be in this town 
		Tryin to figure out the time zones makin me crazy 

		Chorus: 

		You say good morning 
		When it's midnight 
		Going out of my head 
		Alone in this bed 
		I wake up to your sunset 
		It's drivin me mad 
		I miss you so bad 
		and my heart heart heart is so jetlagged 

		What time is it where you are? 
		5 more days and i'll be home 
		I keep your picture in my car 
		I hate the thought of you alone 
		I've been keeping busy all the time 
		Just to try to keep you off my mind 
		Tryin to figure out the time zones makin me crazy 

		[Chorus] 

		I've been keepin busy all time 
		Just to try to keep you off my mind 
		Tryin to figure out the time zones makin me crazy 
		I miss you so bad 
		I wanna share your horizon 
		and see the same sunrising 
		Turn the hour hand back to when you were holding me. 

		[Chorus 2x]

			I gotta find my way back
			back to summer paradise
			Sean Paul, Simple Plan.

			My heart is sinking as I'm lifting
			Up above the clouds away from you
			And I can't believe I'm leaving
			Oh I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do

			But someday
			I will find my way back to where
			Your name Is written in the sand (stay in my brain)

			'Cause I remember every sunset
			I remember every word you said
			We were never gonna say goodbye, yeah
			Singing la-la-ta-ta-ta

			Tell me how to get back to
			Back to summer paradise with you
			And I'll be there in a heartbeat
			(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh
			I'll be there in a heartbeat
			(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh (tell 'em)

			My soul is broken
			Streets are frozen
			I can't stop these feelings melting through
			And I'd give away a thousand days, oh
			Just to have another one with you (baby girl)
			Well, real life can wait (It can wait)
			I'm crashing like waves (yeah)
			Playing in the sand (me and you girl)
			Holding your hand (make some noise)

			'Cause I remember every sunset (I remember)
			I remember every word you said
			We were never gonna say goodbye
			Singing la-ta-ta-ta-ta
			Tell me how to get back to
			Back to summer paradise with you, (yeah)
			And I'll be there in a heartbeat
			(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh
			I'll be there in a heartbeat
			(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh '

			The promises that we made to about our friends,
			Thinking about it shine shine under trees,
			Summer time on the beach,
			Of fine we get closer under them trees,
			Baby girl, you really got to me

			It's 3 o'clock, and were together and the time doesn't leave
			In a heartbeat girl, sex on the beach
			Don't stand your world, ask me I'm rich,
			Loving you girl, is the best part of me

			Someday, I will find my way back
			To where your name
			Is written in the sand
			(Bring it back, bring it back) (rewind)

			'Cause I remember every sunset (I remember)
			I remember every word you said
			We were never gonna say goodbye (no way)
			Singing la-ta-ta-ta-ta

			Tell me how to get back to
			Back to summer paradise with you
			Yeah, and I'll be there in a heartbeat
			I remember where we first kissed (I remember)

			How I didn't wanna leave your lips
			And how I've never ever felt so high (so high)
			Singing La-la-ta-ta-ta
			So tell me how to get back to
			Back to summer paradise with you
			I'll be there in a heartbeat
			(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh
			I'll be there in a heartbeat
			(Quick time, quick time girl), Oh-oh
			Summer Paradise
			I'll be there in a heart, yeah
