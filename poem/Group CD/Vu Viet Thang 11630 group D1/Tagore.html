<h1>Life and works</h1>
<p>Rabindranath Tagore (7 May 1861 - 7 August 1941), was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913.<br><br>
A Pirali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy endures also in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University.<br><br>
Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's Jana Gana Mana and Bangladesh's Amar Shonar Bangla. Some sources state that Sri Lanka's National Anthem was written by Tagore whilst others state it was inspired by his work

<p style="font-size:100%;">
Your questioning eyes are sad.<br>
They seek to know my meaning as the moon would fathom the sea. <br>
<br>
I have bared my life before your eyes from end to end, with nothing hidden or held back. <br>
That is why you know me not. <br>
<br>
If it were only a gem, <br>
I could break it into a hundred pieces and string them into a chain to put on your neck. <br>

If it were only a flower, round and small and sweet, <br>
I could pluck it from its stem to set it in your hair. <br>
<br>
But it is a heart, my beloved. <br>
Where are its shores and its bottom ? <br>
<br>
You know not the limits of this kingdom, <br>
still you are its queen. <br>
<br>
If it were only a moment of pleasure it would flower in an easy smile, <br>
and you could see it and read it in a moment. <br>
<br>
If it were merely a pain it would melt in limpid tears, <br>
reflecting its inmost secret without a word. <br>
<br>
But it is love, my beloved. <br>
<br>
Its pleasure and pain are boundless, <br>
and endless its wants and wealth. <br>
<br>
It is as near to you as your life, <br>
but you can never wholly know it.<br>

<p style="font-size:100%;">
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;<br>
Where knowledge is free;<br>
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;<br>
Where words come out from the depth of truth;<br>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection:<br>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;<br>
Where the mind is lead forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action–<br>
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

<p style="font-size:100%;">
Leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads! <br>
Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut? <br>
Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee! <br>
<br>
He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground <br>
and where the pathmaker is breaking stones. <br>
He is with them in sun and in shower, <br>
and his garment is covered with dust. <br>
Put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil! <br>
<br>
Deliverance? <br>
Where is this deliverance to be found? <br>
Our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation; <br>
he is bound with us all for ever. <br>
<br>
Come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense! <br>
What harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained? <br>
Meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow. <br>
