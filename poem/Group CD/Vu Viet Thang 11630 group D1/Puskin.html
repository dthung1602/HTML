    <h1>Life and works</h1>
<p>Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin 6 June 1799 – 10 February 1837 was a Russian poet, playwright, and novelist of the Romantic era who is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet and the founder of modern Russian literature.<br><br>
Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great-grandfather was Abram Petrovich Gannibal, who was kidnapped from equatorial Africa and raised in the household of Peter the Great. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum.<br><br>
While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832.<br><br>
Pushkin was fatally wounded in a duel with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthès, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment who attempted to seduce the poet's wife, Natalia Pushkina.</p>

<p style="font-size:100%;">I loved you; even now I must confess,<br>
Some embers of my love their fire retain;<br>
But do not let it cause you more distress,<br><br>
I do not want to sadden you again.<br>
Hopeless and tonguetied, yet I loved you dearly<br>
With pangs the jealous and the timid know;<br>
So tenderly I love you, so sincerely,<br>
I pray God grant another love you so.<br>

<p style="font-size:100%;">In alien lands I keep the body<br>
Of ancient native rites and things:<br>
I gladly free a little birdie<br>
At celebration of the spring.<br>
<br>
I'm now free for consolation,<br>
And thankful to almighty Lord:<br>
At least, to one of his creations<br>
I've given freedom in this world!<br>

<p> 
To the Fountain Of the Palace Of the Bakchisarai<br>
The stream of love, the stream alive,<br>
I brought to thee two roses, as a present.<br>
I like the ceaseless murmur thy,<br>
And lyric tears, still and pleasant.<br>
<br>
Thy silver dust, that hangs in air,<br>
Drops onto me like dew of morning,<br>
Oh, go, go, dear flowing,<br>
Sing, sing to me thy saga fair.<br>
<br>
The stream of love, the stream of sadness!<br>
And I have asked thy marble's white:<br>
I've read the praise to lands of aliens,<br>
But Mary was not there implied.<br>
<br>
The pale star of the harem, dreary!<br>
Are you forgotten in a past?<br>
Or whether Zarema and Mary<br>
Are only happy dreams for us?<br>
<br>
And only dreamed imagination<br>
Had drowned in the empty dark<br>
Its flitting visions' pale reflections,<br>
The soul fancy's easy mark?<br>
