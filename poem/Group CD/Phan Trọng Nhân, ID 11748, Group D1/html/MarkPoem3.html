 <p align="center">  O Lord, our God,<br>
Help us to tear their soldiers<br>
To bloody shreds with our shells;<br>
Help us to cover their smiling fields<br>
With the pale forms of their patriot dead; Help us to drown the thunder of<br>
the guns With the shrieks of their wounded,<br>
Writhing in pain. <br>
<br>
Help us to lay waste their humble homes<br>
With a hurricane of fire;<br>
Help us to wring the hearts of their<br>
Unoffending widows with unavailing grief; Help us to turn them out roofless<br>
With their little children to wander unfriended The wastes of their<br>
desolated land<br>
In rags and hunger and thirst,<br>
Sports of the sun flames of summer<br>
And the icy winds of winter,<br>
Burdened in spirit, worn with travail,<br>
Imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it - <br>
<br>
For our sakes who adore Thee, Lord,<br>
Blast their hopes,<br>
Blight their lives,<br>
Protract their bitter pilgrimage,<br>
Make heavy their steps,<br>
Water their way with their tears,<br>
Stain the white snow with the blood<br>
Of their wounded feet! <br>
<br>
We ask it in the spirit of love -<br>
Of Him who is the source of love,<br>
And Who is the ever-faithful<br>
Refuge and Friend of all that are sore beset And seek His aid with humble<br>
and contrite hearts. <br>
<br>
Amen<br> </p>
