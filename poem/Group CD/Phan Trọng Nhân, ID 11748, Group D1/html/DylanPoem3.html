<p align="center">Never until the mankind making<br>
Bird beast and flower<br>
Fathering and all humbling darkness<br>
Tells with silence the last light breaking<br>
And the still hour<br>
Is come of the sea tumbling in harness<br>
<br>
And I must enter again the round<br>
Zion of the water bead<br>
And the synagogue of the ear of corn<br>
Shall I let pray the shadow of a sound<br>
Or sow my salt seed<br>
In the least valley of sackcloth to mourn<br>
<br>
The majesty and burning of the child's death.<br>
I shall not murder<,br>
The mankind of her going with a grave truth<<br>
Nor blaspheme down the stations of the breath<br>
With any further<br>
Elegy of innocence and youth.<br>
<br>
Deep with the first dead lies London's daughter,<br>
Robed in the long friends,<br>
The grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother,<br>
Secret by the unmourning water<br>
Of the riding Thames.<br>
After the first death, there is no other. <br> </p>
