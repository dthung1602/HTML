<p align="center">   Genius, like gold and precious stones, <br>
is chiefly prized because of its rarity. <br>
<br>
Geniuses are people who dash of weird, wild, <br>
incomprehensible poems with astonishing facility, <br>
and get booming drunk and sleep in the gutter. <br>
<br>
Genius elevates its possessor to ineffable spheres <br>
far above the vulgar world and fills his soul <br>
with regal contempt for the gross and sordid things of earth. <br>
<br>
It is probably on account of this <br>
that people who have genius <br>
do not pay their board, as a general thing. <br>
<br>
Geniuses are very singular. <br>
<br>
If you see a young man who has frowsy hair <br>
and distraught look, and affects eccentricity in dress, <br>
you may set him down for a genius. <br>
<br>
If he sings about the degeneracy of a world <br>
which courts vulgar opulence <br>
and neglects brains, <br>
he is undoubtedly a genius. <br>
<br>
If he is too proud to accept assistance, <br>
and spurns it with a lordly air <br>
at the very same time <br>
that he knows he can't make a living to save his life, <br>
he is most certainly a genius. <br>
<br>
If he hangs on and sticks to poetry, <br>
notwithstanding sawing wood comes handier to him, <br>
he is a true genius. <br>
<br>
If he throws away every opportunity in life <br>
and crushes the affection and the patience of his friends <br>
and then protests in sickly rhymes of his hard lot, <br>
and finally persists, <br>
in spite of the sound advice of persons who have got sense <br>
but not any genius, <br>
persists in going up some infamous back alley <br>
dying in rags and dirt, <br>
he is beyond all question a genius. <br>
<br>
But above all things, <br>
to deftly throw the incoherent ravings of insanity into verse <br>
and then rush off and get booming drunk, <br>
is the surest of all the different signs <br>
of genius. <br> </p>
