  <p align="center"> And death shall have no dominion. <br>
Dead man naked they shall be one <br>
With the man in the wind and the west moon; <br>
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,<br>
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;<br>
Though they go mad they shall be sane,<br>
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;<br> 
Though lovers be lost love shall not;<br>
And death shall have no dominion.<br>
<br>
And death shall have no dominion.<br>
Under the windings of the sea<br>
They lying long shall not die windily;<br>
Twisting on racks when sinews give way,<br>
Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break; <br>
Faith in their hands shall snap in two,<br>
And the unicorn evils run them through; <br>
Split all ends up they shan't crack; <br>
And death shall have no dominion.<br>
<br>
And death shall have no dominion.<br>
No more may gulls cry at their ears<br>
Or waves break loud on the seashores; <br>
Where blew a flower may a flower no more<br>
Lift its head to the blows of the rain; <br>
Though they be mad and dead as nails,<br>
Heads of the characters hammer through daisies; <br>
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,<br>
And death shall have no dominion. <br> </p>
