<b>Princess Shokushi</b> (a. k. a. Shikishi (Shikishi Naishinno), born in 1149 or 1150, died in 1201) was the third daughter of Emperor Go-Shirakawa.
At the age of nine or ten, in 1159, she was appointed to serve as sai'in (high priestess) at Kamo Shrines and acted as one until she resigned
in 1169, likely due to an illness.
<br><br>
Not much is known about <b>Shokushi</b>'s life after she resined from the Kamo Shrines if not diaries of Fujiwara no Teika (Meigetsuki) and Minamoto no Ienaga
 (Minamoto no Ienaga nikki). After she resigned she studied poetry under Fujiwara no Shunzei and later his son, Fujiwara no Teika (poem 97).
<br><br>
She was an excellent poetess and even in her time, she was estimated as very talented. The love poems written by Princess Shokushi are believed
to be too emotionally profound to be written simply for the sake of traditional poetic convention. She left a kashu and has 155 poems in imperial
anthologies. In 1183's Senzai Wakashu Shunzei inlcuded nine of her poems. With the number of poems included in Shin Kokin Wakashu, she outnumbered even Teika.
<br><br>
In his diary Teika wrote that he first met Shokushi in 1181, when he was 19 and she was around 30. The diary also confirms that the two regularly
exchanged letters and he greatly admired her poetry. In two years before her death, Teika visited Shokushi with great frequency. All of this has
become a basis for suspicion of a love affair between them.
