<td><p style="font-size: 18px;">William Shakespeare(26 April 1564-23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, 
widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.
Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire.
Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613. 
At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. 
Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, 
and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. 
He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later. 
Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, 
sexuality, and religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.
Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime.
In the 20th and 21st centuries, his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance.
His plays remain highly popular, and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.
