LXXVIII<br><br>

So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,<br>
And found such fair assistance in my verse<br>
As every alien pen hath got my use<br>
And under thee their poesy disperse.<br>
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing<br>
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,<br>
Have added feathers to the learned's wing<br>
And given grace a double majesty.<br>
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,<br>
Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:<br>
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,<br>
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;<br>
But thou art all my art, and dost advance<br>
As high as learning my rude ignorance.<br><br>

LXXIX<br><br>

Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,<br>
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;<br>
But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,<br>
And my sick Muse doth give an other place.<br>
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument<br>
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;<br>
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent<br>
He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.<br>
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word<br>
From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,<br>
And found it in thy cheek: he can afford<br>
No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.<br>
Then thank him not for that which he doth say,<br>
Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.<br><br>

LXXX<br><br>

O! how I faint when I of you do write,<br>
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,<br>
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,<br>
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.<br>
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,<br>
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,<br>
My saucy bark, inferior far to his,<br>
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.<br>
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,<br>
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;<br>
Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,<br>
He of tall building, and of goodly pride:<br>
Then if he thrive and I be cast away,<br>
The worst was this, my love was my decay.<br><br>

LXXXI<br><br>

Or I shall live your epitaph to make,<br>
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,<br>
From hence your memory death cannot take,<br>
Although in me each part will be forgotten.<br>
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,<br>
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:<br>
The earth can yield me but a common grave,<br>
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.<br>
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,<br>
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;<br>
And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,<br>
When all the breathers of this world are dead;<br>
You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen,<br>
Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.<br>

LXXXII<br><br>

I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,<br>
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook<br>
The dedicated words which writers use<br>
Of their fair subject, blessing every book.<br>
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,<br>
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;<br>
And therefore art enforced to seek anew<br>
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.<br>
And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,<br>
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,<br>
Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd<br>
In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;<br>
And their gross painting might be better usd<br>
Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abusd.<br><br>

LXXXIII<br><br>

I never saw that you did painting need,<br>
And therefore to your fair no painting set;<br>
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed<br>
The barren tender of a poet's debt:<br>
And therefore have I slept in your report,<br>
That you yourself, being extant, well might show<br>
How far a modern quill doth come too short,<br>
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.<br>
This silence for my sin you did impute,<br>
Which shall be most my glory being dumb;<br>
For I impair not beauty being mute,<br>
When others would give life, and bring a tomb.<br>
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes<br>
Than both your poets can in praise devise.<br>

LXXXIV<br><br>

Who is it that says most, which can say more,<br>
Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you,<br>
In whose confine immured is the store<br>
Which should example where your equal grew?<br>
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell<br>
That to his subject lends not some small glory;<br>
But he that writes of you, if he can tell<br>
That you are you, so dignifies his story.<br>
Let him but copy what in you is writ,<br>
Not making worse what nature made so clear,<br>
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,<br>
Making his style admired every where.<br>
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,<br>
Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.<br>

LXXXV<br><br>

My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,<br>
While comments of your praise richly compiled,<br>
Reserve thy character with golden quill,<br>
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.<br>
I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,<br>
And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'<br>
To every hymn that able spirit affords,<br>
In polished form of well-refined pen.<br>
Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'<br>
And to the most of praise add something more;<br>
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,<br>
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.<br>
Then others, for the breath of words respect,<br>
Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.<br>

LXXXVI<br><br>

Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,<br>
Bound for the prize of all too precious you,<br>
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,<br>
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?<br>
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write<br>
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?<br>
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night<br>
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.<br>
He, nor that affable familiar ghost<br>
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,<br>
As victors of my silence cannot boast;<br>

I was not sick of any fear from thence:<br>
But when your countenance filled up his line,<br>
Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine. <br>
