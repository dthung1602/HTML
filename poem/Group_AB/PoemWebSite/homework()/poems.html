			I heard a fly buzz when I died;<br>
			The stillness round my form<br>
			Was like the stillness in the air<br>
			Between the heaves of storm.<br>
			The eyes beside had wrung them dry,<br>
			And breaths were gathering sure<br>
			For that last onset, when the king<br>
			Be witnessed in his power.<br>
			I willed my keepsakes, signed away<br>
			What portion of me I<br>
			Could make assignable, â€” and then<br>
			There interposed a fly,<br>

			With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,<br>
			Between the light and me;<br>
			And then the windows failed, and then<br>
			I could not see to see.

	<p align="center">
	A Bird, came down the Walk  &#8209 <br>
	He did not know I saw &#8209 <br>
	He bit an Angle Worm in halves <br>
	And ate the fellow, raw, <br>
	<br>
	And then, he drank a Dew<br>
	From a convenient Grass &#8209 <br>
	And then hopped sidewise to the Wall<br> 
	To let a Beetle pass &#8209 <br>
	<br>
	He glanced with rapid eyes,<br>
	That hurried all abroad &#8209 <br>
	They looked like frightened Beads, I thought,<br>
	He stirred his Velvet Head. &#8209 <br>
	<br>
	Like one in danger, Cautious,<br>
	I offered him a Crumb,<br>
	And he unrolled his feathers, <br>
	And rowed him softer Home &#8209 <br>
 <br>
	Than Oars divide the Ocean,<br>
	Too silver for a seam,<br>
	Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon, <br>
	Leap, plashless as they swim. <br>

<p align="center">
	Because I could not stop for Death &#8209 <br>
	He kindly stopped for me &#8209 <br>
	The Carriage held but just Ourselves &#8209 <br>
	And Immortality.  <br>
<br>
	We slowly drove &#8209 He knew no haste <br>
	And I had put away <br>
	My labor and my leisure too, <br>
	For His Civility &#8209 <br>
<br>
	We passed the School, where Children strove <br>
	At Recess &#8209 in the Ring &#8209 <br>
	We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain &#8209 <br>
	We passed the Setting Sun &#8209 <br>
<br>
	Or rather &#8209 He passed Us &#8209 <br>
	The Dews drew quivering and Chill &#8209 <br>
	For only Gossamer, my Gown &#8209 <br>
	My Tippet &#8209 only Tulle &#8209 <br>
<br>
	We paused before a House that seemed <br>
	A Swelling of the Ground &#8209 <br>
	The Roof was scarcely visible &#8209 <br>
	The Cornice &#8209 in the Ground &#8209 <br>
<br>
	Since then &#8209 'tis Centuries &#8209 and yet <br>
	Feels shorter than the Day <br>
	I first surmised the Horses' Heads <br>
	Were toward Eternity &#8209 <br>

			Perhaps if death is kind, and there can be returning,<br>
			We will come back to earth some fragrant night,<br>
			And take these lanes to find the sea, and bending<br>
			Breathe the same honeysuckle, low and white.<br>

			We will come down at night to these resounding beaches<br>
			And the long gentle thunder of the sea,<br>
			Here for a single hour in the wide starlight<br>
			We shall be happy, for the dead are free.

<p align="center"> 
		I thought I had forgotten, <br>
		But it all came back again <br>
		To-night with the first spring thunder <br>
		In a rush of rain.<br>
	<br>
		I remembered a darkened doorway <br>
		Where we stood while the storm swept by, <br>
		Thunder gripping the earth <br>
		And lightning scrawled on the sky.<br>
	<br>
		The passing motor busses swayed, <br>
		For the street was a river of rain, <br>
		Lashed into little golden waves <br>
		In the lamp light's stain.<br>
	<br>
		With the wild spring rain and thunder <br>
		My heart was wild and gay; <br>
		Your eyes said more to me that night<br>
		Than your lips would ever say. . . .<br>
	<br>
		I thought I had forgotten, <br>
		But it all came back again <br>
		To-night with the first spring thunder <br>
		In a rush of rain.<br>

<p align="center">
		I am alone, in spite of love, <br>
		In spite of all I take and give &#8209 <br>
		In spite of all your tenderness,<br>
		Sometimes I am not glad to live.<br>
	<br>
		I am alone, as though I stood<br>
		On the highest peak of the tired gray world,<br>
		About me only swirling snow,<br>
		Above me, endless space unfurled;<br>
	<br>
		With earth hidden and heaven hidden,<br>
		And only my own spirit's pride<br>
		To keep me from the peace of those<br>
		Who are not lonely, having died.<br>
