Emily Elizabeth Dickinson (December 10, 1830 &#8209 May 15, 1886) was an American poet. Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts. 
Although part of a prominent family with strong ties to its community, Dickinson lived much of her life in reclusive isolation.
 After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before 
 returning to her family's house in Amherst. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a noted penchant for white clothing 
 and became known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. 
 Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.

While Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly 1,800 poems were published during her lifetime.
 The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered significantly by the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time.
 Dickinson's poems are unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, 
 and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death 
 and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.

Although Dickinson's acquaintances were most likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886&#8209when Lavinia, 
Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems&#8209that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public.
Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, 
though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for 
the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955. Despite some unfavorable reception
 and skepticism over the late 19th and early 20th centuries regarding her literary prowess, Dickinson is now almost universally 
 considered to be one of the most significant of all American poets.

Teasdale was born on August 8, 1884. She had such poor health for so much of her childhood,
home schooled until age 9, that it was only at age 10 that she was well enough to begin school. 
She started at Mary Institute in 1898, but switched to Hosmer Hall in 1899, graduating in 1903. 
The Teasdale family resided at 3668 Lindell Blvd. and then 38 Kingsbury Place in St. Louis, Missouri.
Both homes were designed by Sara's mother. The house on Kingsbury Place had a private suite for 
Sara on the second floor. Guests entered through a separate entrance and were admitted by appointment. 
This suite is where Sara worked, slept, and often dined alone.
<br>
Teasdale's first poem was published in William Marion Reedy's Reedy's Mirror, a local newspaper, in 1907. 
Her first collection of poems, Sonnets to Duse and Other Poems, was published that same year.
Teasdale's second collection, Helen of Troy and Other Poems, was published in 1911. It was well 
received by critics, who praised its lyrical mastery and romantic subject matter.
<br>
From 1911 to 1914 Teasdale was courted by several men, including the poet Vachel Lindsay, who was 
truly in love with her but did not feel that he could provide enough money or stability to keep her 
satisfied. She chose to marry Ernst Filsinger, a longtime admirer of her poetry, on December 19, 1914.
<br>
Teasdale's third poetry collection, Rivers to the Sea, was published in 1915. It was and is a bestseller, 
being reprinted several times. In 1916 she and Filsinger moved to New York City, where they lived in an 
Upper West Side apartment on Central Park West.
<br>
In 1918 she won a Pulitzer Prize for her 1917 poetry collection Love Songs. It was "made possible by a 
special grant from The Poetry Society"; however, the sponsoring organization now lists it as the earliest 
Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (inaugurated 1922).
<br>
Filsinger's constant business travel caused Teasdale much loneliness. In 1929, she moved interstate for
three months, thereby satisfying the criteria to gain a divorce. She did not wish to inform Filsinger, only doing so at her lawyers' insistence as the divorce was going through. Filsinger was shocked. After the divorce she moved only two blocks from her old home on Central Park West. She rekindled her friendship with Vachel Lindsay, who was now married with children.
<br>
In 1933, she died by suicide, overdosing on sleeping pills. Lindsay had died by suicide two years earlier. She is interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.
