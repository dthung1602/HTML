		<p align="left"><font size="4">Featuring the anthemic songwriting of Ryan Tedder, OneRepublic rose to prominence in 2007, when "Apologize" began its reign as the most popular digital download in American history. 
		Although the song proved to be a quick success, OneRepublic had spent five years touring the musical minor leagues before its release, with Tedder splitting his time between the band's work and production gigs for other artists. 
		Tedder and Zach Filkins formed the band in 2002 and relocated to Los Angeles shortly thereafter, adding keyboardist Drew Brown, bassist/cellist Brent Kutzle, and drummer Eddie Fisher to the lineup in the process. 
		OneRepublic then signed with Sony BMG's Columbia label in 2003; three years later, however, the bandmates returned from a performance at Coachella to find themselves dropped from Columbia's roster.<br> 
Nevertheless, OneRepublic's popularity continued to soar on MySpace, and Tedder helped raise the group's profile by penning songs for artists like Blake Lewis and Hilary Duff.
Hip-hop producer Timbaland (with whom Tedder had already worked for several years) took notice of the group's audience and signed OneRepublic to his own Mosley Music Group, a joint venture with Interscope Records. 
Timbaland also remixed one of the group's most promising tracks, "Apologize," and included it on his own album, 2007's Timbaland Presents Shock Value. 
The song quickly became a platinum-selling single in many countries, breaking airplay records in the U.K. and selling an unprecedented 4.3 million digital downloads in America alone.<br> 
Later that year, OneRepublic stepped out on their own with Dreaming Out Loud, a debut album filled with piano-fueled songwriting and pop/rock melodies. 
The album quickly went gold, and "Apologize" continued to top the singles charts in multiple countries. 
Another Tedder-penned track, Leona Lewis' "Bleeding Love," experienced similar success at the same time, thus making Tedder one of the year's most celebrated songwriters. 
OneRepublic began writing songs for a second album in 2008, and the group later decamped to Colorado Springs to avoid outside distractions. 
Although initially planned for a summer release, Waking Up wasn't completed until September 2009. 
"All the Right Moves," the album's lead single, was released to radio that same month, while the entire album followed in November.<br> 
In 2013, OneRepublic returned with their third studio album, Native, featuring the singles "Feel Again," "If I Lose Myself," and their biggest hit to date, "Counting Stars." 
During the group's subsequent extensive world tour, a deluxe version of Native was released, featuring the hit "Love Runs Out," which reached number 15 on the Hot 100 and was a Top Ten hit in several other countries. 
As touring continued, the band began recording its follow-up album. 
Written in 16 cities across 12 countries, Oh My My captured the sound and flavor of locales like Turkey, Brazil, Spain, and Russia, and was released in late 2016. ~ Andrew Leahey, Rovi<br><br>

I need another story<br>
Something to get off my chest<br>
My life gets kinda boring<br>
Need something that I can confess<br>
<br>
'Til all my sleeves are stained red<br>
From all the truth that I've said<br>
Come by it honestly I swear<br>
Thought you saw me wink, no<br>
I've been on the brink, so<br>
<br>
Tell me what you want to hear<br>
Something that will light those ears<br>
Sick of all the insincere<br>
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away<br>
<br>
This time don't need another perfect lie<br>
Don't care if critics ever jump in line<br>
I'm gonna give all my secrets away<br>
<br>
My God, amazing how we got this far<br>
It's like we're chasing all those stars<br>
Who's driving shiny big black cars<br>
And everyday I see the news<br>
All the problems that we could solve<br>
And when a situation rises<br>
Just write it into an album<br>
Send it straight to gold<br>
But I don't really like my flow, no, so<br>
<br>
Tell me what you want to hear<br>
Something that will light those ears<br>
Sick of all the insincere<br>
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away<br>
<br>
This time, don't need another perfect lie<br>
Don't care if critics ever jump in line<br>
I'm gonna give all my secrets away<br>
<br>
Oh, got no reason, got no shame<br>
Got no family I can blame<br>
Just don't let me disappear<br>
I'ma tell you everything<br>
<br>
So tell me what you want to hear<br>
Something that will light those ears<br>
Sick of all the insincere<br>
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away<br>
<br>
This time, don't need another perfect lie<br>
Don't care if critics ever jump in line<br>
I'm gonna give all my secrets away<br>
<br>
So tell me what you want to hear<br>
Something that will light those ears<br>
Sick of all the insincere<br>
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away<br>
<br>
This time, don't need another perfect lie<br>
Don't care if critics ever jump in line<br>
I'm gonna give all my secrets away<br>
All my secrets away, all my secrets away

I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground<br>
And I'm hearing what you say, but I just can't make a sound<br>
You tell me that you need me then you go and cut me down, but wait<br>
You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around, and say (that)<br>
<br>
"It's too late to apologize (it's too late)."<br>
I said, "It's too late to apologize (it's too late)."<br>
<br>
I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you<br>
And I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothin' new (yeah)<br>
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue, and you say,<br>
"Sorry," like the angel heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraid...<br>
<br>
"It's too late to apologize (it's too late)."<br>
I said, "It's too late to apologize (it's too late)."<br>

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep<br>
Dreaming about the things that we could be<br>
But, baby I've been, I've been praying hard<br>
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars<br>
Yeah, we'll be counting stars<br>
<br>
I see this life like a swinging vine,<br>
Swing my heart across the line<br>
In my face is flashing signs,<br>
Seek it out and ye shall find.<br>
<br>
Old but I'm not that old<br>
Young but I'm not that bold<br>
And I don't think the world is sold<br>
I'm just doing what we're told<br>
<br>
I I I I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing<br>
And I I I I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing<br>
<br>
I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?<br>
Every thing that kills me makes me feel alive.<br>
<br>
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep<br>
Dreaming about the things that we could be<br>

<br>
Ye-e-yeah<br>
<br>
I feel her love<br>
And I feel it burn down this river every time<br>
Hope is our four-letter word, make that money watch it burn<br>
<br>
Old but, I'm not that old<br>
Young, but I'm not that bold<br>
And I don't think the world is sold<br>
I'm just doing what we're told<br>
<br>
And I I I I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing<br>
I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?<br>
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly<br>
<br>

<br>
Oh, take that money watch it burn,<br>
Sing in the river the lessons I learned<br>
Take that money watch it burn,<br>
Sing in the river the lessons I learned<br>
Take that money watch it burn,<br>
Sing in the river the lessons I learned<br>
