Today I don't feel like doing anything<br>
I just wanna lay in my bed<br>
Don't feel like picking up my phone<br>
So leave a message at the tone<br>
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.<br>
<br>
Uh<br>
I'm gonna kick my feet up<br>
Then stare at the fan<br>
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants<br>
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't<br>
<br>
I'll be lounging on the couch,<br>
Just chillin' in my snuggie<br>
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie<br>
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man<br>
<br>
Oh, yes I said it<br>
I said it<br>
I said it 'cause I can<br>

Today I don't feel like doing anything<br>

Don't feel like picking up my phone<br>

Nothing at all!<br>
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
Nothing at all<br>
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh<br>

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X<br>
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex<br>
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great!)<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
I might mess around, and get my college degree<br>
I bet my old man will be so proud of me<br>
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait<br>
Haha<br>
<br>
Oh, yes I said it<br>

I said it 'cause I can<br>

Today I don't feel like doing anything<br>
I just wanna lay in my bed<br>
Don't feel like picking up my phone<br>
So leave a message at the tone<br>
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything<br>
<br>
No, I ain't gonna comb my hair<br>
'Cause I ain't going anywhere<br>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no<br>
I'll just strut in my birthday suit<br>
And let everything hang loose<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
