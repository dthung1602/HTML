	<b>Alexander Igoryevich Rybak</b> (Alyaksandr Iharavich Rybak; born 13 May 1986) is a Norwegian singer-composer, violinist, pianist, 
	actor and presenter/host. Representing Norway in <b>the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest</b> in Moscow, Russia, Rybak won the contest 
	with 387 points-the highest tally any country has achieved in the history of Eurovision under the old voting system-with <b>"Fairytale"</b>,
	a song he wrote and composed. His debut album, Fairytales, charted in the top 20 in nine European countries, including a No. 1 
	position in Norway and Russia. Rybak made a return to Eurovision in 2012 and 2016, playing the violin during both interval acts.
	<p>
	<b>Rybak</b> was born in Minsk, Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet Union. He became a student at the Barratt Due Institute of Music
	in Oslo at the age of 10. As a result of his success in the <b>Eurovision Song Contest</b>, he took a break from his bachelor's degree studies 
	at the institute, but in 2011, he returned to his studies and in June 2012, he graduated from Barratt Due Institute of Music with a Bachelor
	of Music in violin performance.

	Years ago, when I was younger<br>
I kinda liked, a girl I knew<br>
She was mine, and we were sweethearts<br>
That was then, but then it’s true<br>
<br>
I’m in love, with a fairytale<br>
Even though it hurts<br>
Coz I don’t care if I lose my mind<br>
I’m already cursed<br>
<br>
Everyday, we started fighting<br>
Every night, we fell in love<br>
No one else, could make me sadder<br>
But no one else, could lift me high above<br>
<br>
I don’t know, what I was doing<br>
When suddenly, we fell apart<br>
Nowadays, I cannot find her<br>
But when I do, we’ll get a brand new start<br>
<br>
I’m in love, with a fairytale<br>
Even though it hurts<br>
Coz I don’t care if I lose my mind<br>
I’m already cursed<br>
<br>
She’s a fairytale, yeah<br>
Even though it hurts<br>
Coz I don’t care if I lose my mind<br>
I’m already cursed<br>

Singing oah<br>
I love you moah<br>
You're way too young for me<br>
But I don't mind<br>

Never mind what your girlfriends say<br>
Deep inside I'm quite okay<br>
I may have fooled around once or twice<br>
But I really need you<br>
And it's not like I'm the only guy<br>
I know how you make them cry<br>
So let's start by being friends<br>
And let this friendship never end<br>
<br>
I knew you years ago<br>
When I was - I don't know<br>
But let you say it's love<br>
<br>
Singing oah<br>
I love you Moa<br>
You're way too young for me<br>
But I don't mind<br>
Don't say maybe<br>
Just be my lady<br>
No need to hesitate<br>
'Cause you'll be fine<br>

So tell me what I want to hear<br>
No wait - let's just leave it there<br>
You know I'm not good for you<br>
God - I don't know what to do!<br>
I liked you from the start<br>
You melt my icy heart<br>
And now it's burning out<br>
<br>
Singing oah<br>
I love you Moa<br>
You're way too young for me<br>
But I don't mind<br>
Don't say maybe<br>
Just be my lady<br>
No need to hesitate<br>
'Cause you'll be fine<br>
<br>
Don't go away<br>
All what's left of me<br>
I once believed you was in my soul<br>
But if you saw me now - crying secretly<br>
Would you hold my hand and never let it go?<br>

Singing oah<br>
I love you Moa<br>
You're way too young for me<br>
But I don't mind<br>
Don't say maybe<br>
Just be my lady<br>
No need to hesitate<br>
'Cause you'll be fine<br>
<br>
I'm Singing oah<br>
'Cause I love you Moa<br>
You're way too young for me<br>
But I don't mind<br>
Don't say maybe<br>
Just be my lady<br>
No need to hesitate<br>
'Cause you'll be fine<br>

Now I'm home, but I cannot stay<br>
I dream of you every day<br>
Got to know every inch of you<br>
Will you make my dream come true?<br>
<br>
There's no place like home they say<br>
You're my home, so hear me pray.<br>
<br>
I don't know you, but I need more time<br>
Promise me you'll be mine<br>
Birds are flying over Europe skies,<br>
Tell me please why can't I?<br>
<br>
Times have changed, but so have I<br>
I view my life through your eyes<br>
On the go in my tourist's shoes<br>
But I'll stay truthful to you<br>
<br>
Cause there's no place like home they say<br>
You're my home, so I guess I'll stay.<br>
<br>
I don't know you, but I need more time<br>
Promise me you'll be mine<br>
Birds are flying over Europe skies<br>
Tell me please why can't I?<br>
<br>
I don't know you, but I need more time<br>
Promise me you'll be mine<br>
Birds are flying over Europe skies<br>
Tell me please why can't I?<br>
