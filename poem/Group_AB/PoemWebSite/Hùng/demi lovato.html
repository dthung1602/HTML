<p align="center">Tell me what you want<br>
What you like<br>
It's okay<br>
I'm a little curious, too<br>
Tell me if it's wrong<br>
If it's right<br>
I don't care<br>
I can keep a secret, can you?<br>
<br>
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind<br>
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite<br><br>

Don't tell your mother<br>
Kiss one another<br>
Die for each other<br>
We're cool for the summer<br>
(Ha)<br><br>

Ooh, ooh<br><br>

Take me down into your paradise<br>
Don't be scared 'cause I'm your body type<br>
Just something that we wanna try<br>
'Cause you and I<br>
We're cool for the summer<br><br>

Tell me if I won<br>
If I did<br>
What's my prize?<br>
I just wanna play with you, too<br>
Even if they judge<br>
Fuck it<br>
I'll do the time<br>
I just wanna have some fun with you<br>
<br>
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind<br>
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite<br>
<br>
Don't tell your mother<br>
Kiss one another<br>
Die for each other<br>
We're cool for the summer<br>

	<p align="center"><a href="#references"><img src="attack.png" width="609" height="435" border="0"></a></p>
<p align="center">
Puttin’ my defences up<br>
‘Cause I don’t wanna fall in love<br>
If I ever did that<br>
I think I’d have a heart attack<br><br>

Never put my love out on the line<br>
Never said yes to the right guy<br>
Never had trouble getting what I want
<br>But when it comes to you, I’m never good enough<br>
When I don’t care<br>
I can play ‘em like a Ken doll<br>
Won’t wash my hair<br>
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball<br><br>

But you make me wanna act like a girl<br>
Paint my nails and wear high heels<br>
Yea you, make me so nervous<br>
That I just can’t hold your hand<br>
<br>
You make me glow, but I cover up<br>
Won’t let it show, so I’m<br>
Puttin’ my defences up<br>
Cause I don’t wanna fall in love<br>
If I ever did that<br>
I think I’d have a heart attack (x3)<br>
<br>
Never break a sweat for the other guys<br>
When you come around, I get paralyzed<br>
And everytime I try to be myself<br>
It comes out wrong like a cry for help<br>
It’s just not fair<br>
Pain’s more trouble than love is worth<br>
I gasp for air<br>
It feels so good, but you know it hurts<br>
<br>
But you make me wanna act like a girl<br>
Paint my nails and wear perfume<br>
For you, make me so nervous<br>
That I just can’t hold your hand
