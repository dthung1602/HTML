	<p align="center">I thought my heart was gone<br>
After I lost it all<br>
Felt I was falling down<br>
Still I chose to be proud<br>
Until I hit the ground<br><br>

You got me back on my feet again<br>
You said that lovers come and may go<br>
You said that time will pass<br>
But I'll stay your friend<br>
Iâ€™ll help you up when you feel alone<br><br>

I was lonely<br>
But after all you told me I'd be ok<br><br>

Hope that everyone has felt like me<br>
Hold on never leave<br>

<b><li><a name="up">Wake Me Up</a></b>
<p align="center"><a href="#references"><img src="up.jpg" width="600" height="300" border="0"></a></p>
<p align="center">
Feeling my way through the darkness<br>
Guided by a beating heart<br>
I can't tell where the journey will end<br>
But I know where to start<br><br>

They tell me I'm too young to understand<br>
They say I'm caught up in a dream<br>
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes<br>
Well that's fine by me<br><br>

[2x]<br>
So wake me up when it's all over<br>
When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
All this time I was finding myself<br>
And I didn't know I was lost<br><br>

I tried carrying the weight of the world<br>
But I only have two hands<br>
Hope I get the chance to travel the world<br>
But I don't have any plans<br><br>

Wish that I could stay forever this young<br>
Not afraid to close my eyes<br>
Life's a game made for everyone<br>
And love is the prize</p>

<p align="center"><a href="#references"><img src="love.jpg" width="600" height="600" border="0"></a></p>
	<p align="center">
	Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful<br>
And every night has its day, so magical<br>
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle<br>
That can't be defeated<br><br>

For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable<br>
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle<br>
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable<br>
With something to believe in<br><br>

Monday left me broken<br>
Tuesday I was through with hoping<br>
Wednesday my empty arms were open<br>
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love<br>
Thank the stars it's Friday<br>
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday<br>
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday<br>
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love<br>
To come around<br><br>

We are one of a kind irreplaceable<br>
How did I get so blind and so cynical<br>
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable<br>
No, we can't be defeated</p>
