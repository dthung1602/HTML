				<p>I'm at a payphone trying to call home<br>
				All of my change I spent on you<br>
				Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong<br>
				Where are the plans we made for two?</p>

				<p>Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember<br>
				The people we used to be...<br>
				It's even harder to picture,<br>
				That you're not here next to me.</p>
	
				<p>You say it's too late to make it,<br>
				But is it too late to try?<br>
				And in our time that you wasted<br>
				All of our bridges burned down</p>

				<p>I've wasted my nights,<br>
				You turned out the lights<br>
				Now I'm paralyzed.<br>
				Still stuck in the dark<br>
				When we called it love<br>
				But even the sun sets in paradise</p>

				<p>I'm at a payphone trying to call home<br>
				All of my change I spent on you<br>
				Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong<br>
				Where are the plans we made for two?

				<p>If "Happy Ever After" did exist,<br>
				I would still be holding you like this<br>
				All those fairy tales are full of shit<br>
				One more fucking love song, I'll be sick.</p>

				<p>Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow<br>
				'Cause you forgot yesterday.<br>
				I gave you my love to borrow,<br>
				But you just gave it away.</p>
	
				<p>You can't expect me to be fine,<br>
				I don't expect you to care<br>
				I know I've said it before<br>
				But all of our bridges burned down.</p>

				<p>I've wasted my nights,<br>
				You turned out the lights<br>
				Now I'm paralyzed.<br>
				Still stuck in that time<br>
				When we called it love<br>
				But even the sun sets in paradise.</p>

				<p>I'm at a payphone trying to call home<br>
				All of my change I spent on you<br>
				Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong<br>
				Where are the plans we made for two?

				<p>If "Happy Ever After" did exist,<br>
				I would still be holding you like this<br>
				All those fairy tales are full of shit<br>
				One more fucking love song, I'll be sick.<br>
				Now I'm at a payphone...</p>

				<p>Forget that ish<br>
				I'll be out spending all this money<br>
				While you're sitting round wondering<br>
				Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing,<br>
				Made it from the bottom<br>
				Now when you see me I'm stunning,<br>
				And all of my cars start with a push of a button<br>
				Telling me the chances I blew up<br>
				Or whatever you call it,<br>
				Switched the number to my phone<br>
				So you never could call it,<br>
				Don't need my name on my shirt,<br>
				You can tell it I'm ballin.<br>
				Swish, what a shame could have got picked<br>
				Had a really good game but you missed your last shot<br>
				So you talk about who you see at the top<br>
				Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for.<br>
				Phantom pulled up valet open doors<br>
				Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for<br>
				Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take<br>
				That little piece of shit with you.</p>

				<p>I'm at a payphone trying to call home<br>
				All of my change I spent on you<br>
				Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong<br>
				Where are the plans we made for two?</p>

				<p>If "Happy Ever After" did exist,<br>
				I would still be holding you like this<br>
				All those fairy tales are full of shit<br>
				One more fucking love song, I'll be sick.<br>
				Now I'm at a payphone...<a href="#r">[2]</a></P></p>
