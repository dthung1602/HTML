			<p><b>Linkin Park's Formation:</b> <a href="#r_LP">[1]</a></P>
			<p>The seeds of what would become Linkin Park were sown in Southern California in 1996, when three high school friends – drummer Rob Bourdon, guitarist Brad Delson and vocalist Mike Shinoda – decided to form a band. 
			Soon after graduation, they completed their lineup by recruiting three more members: bassist Dave Farrell, turntablist Joe Hahn and temporary lead singer Mark Wakefield. 
			Calling themselves first SuperXero and then simply Xero, the group began recording demos but failed to garner much interest in their songs.</P>
			<p><b>Finalizing the Lineup ... and the Band Name:</b><p>
			<p>Xero’s lack of success spurred the departure of Wakefield, setting the stage for Chester Bennington’s arrival as the band’s frontman in 1999. 
			The group changed their name to Hybrid Theory (a nod to the band’s hybrid sound that combined rock and rap), but after facing legal issues with another act with a similar moniker, the group chose Lincoln Park, in honor of a neighborhood park in Santa Monica, California, that the band members would pass on their way to recording sessions.
			But once the band discovered that others already owned that domain name online, they slightly altered their name to Linkin Park.</P>
			<p><b>Instant Superstars:</p></b>
			<p>Linkin Park released their first album in 2000.
			Hybrid Theory, a reference to the group’s rejected band name, was a massive success, becoming one of the biggest debuts of all time, selling approximately 10 million copies in the U.S. alone and spawning several hit singles like “In the End” and “Crawling.” 
			In the process, the band became one of the most successful acts in the fledgling rap-rock movement.</p>
