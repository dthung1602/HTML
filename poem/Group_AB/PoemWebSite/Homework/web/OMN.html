				<p>You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war.<br>
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the door.<br>
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score.<br>
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more.<br>

<p>Yeah, but baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you.<br>
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go.<br>
Got you stuck on my body, on my body, like a tattoo.<br>
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid, crawling back to you.</p>

<p>So I cross my heart and I hope to die<br>
That I'll only stay with you one more night<br>
And I know I said it a million times<br>
But I'll only stay with you one more night</p>

<p>Try to tell you "no" but my body keeps on telling you "yes".<br>
Try to tell you "stop", but your lipstick got me so out of breath.<br>
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself.<br>
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied but guilty as hell.</p>

<p>Yeah, but baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you.<br>
(Making me love you<br>
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go.<br>
(I let it all go)<br>
Got you stuck on my body, on my body, like a tattoo.<br>
(Like a tattoo, yeah)<br>
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid, crawling back to you.</p>

<p>So I cross my heart and I hope to die<br>
(Yeah)<br>
That I'll only stay with you one more night<br>
(Oh)<br>
And I know I said it a million times<br>
(Yeah)<br>
But I'll only stay with you one more night<br>
(Yeah)</p>

<p>Yeah, baby, give me one more night<br>
Yeah, baby, give me one more night (whoa, yeah)<br>
Yeah, baby, give me one more night (oh, yeah, yeah)</p>

<p>Yeah, but baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you.<br>
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go.<br>
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo.<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>

<p>So I cross my heart and I hope to die<br>
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)<br>
That I'll only stay with you one more night<br>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)<br>
And I know I said it a million times<br>
(Oh, I said it a million times)<br>
But I'll only stay with you one more night<br>
(Yeah, baby give me one more night)</p>

<p>So I cross my heart and I hope to die (yeah, yeah)<br>
