				<p>I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br>
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface<br>
Don't know what you're expecting of me<br>
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes<br>
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)</P>

<P>[Chorus:]<br>
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there<br>
Become so tired, so much more aware<br>
I'm becoming this, all I want to do<br>
Is be more like me and be less like you</P>

<P>Can't you see that you're smothering me,<br>
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?<br>
'Cause everything that you thought I would be<br>
Has fallen apart right in front of you.<br>
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you.<br>
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br>
And every second I waste is more than I can take.</P>

<P>[Chorus:]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there,<br>
Become so tired, so much more aware<br>
I'm becoming this, all I want to do<br>
Is be more like me and be less like you.</P>

<P>And I know<br>
I may end up failing too.<br>
But I know<br>
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you.</P>

<P>[Chorus:]<br>
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there,<br>
Become so tired, so much more aware.<br>
I'm becoming this, all I want to do<br>
Is be more like me and be less like you.</P>

<P>[Chorus:]<br>
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there.<br>
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)<br>
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there.<br>
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)<a href="#r">[2]</a></P>
