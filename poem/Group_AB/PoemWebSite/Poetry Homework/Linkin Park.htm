This is my December<br>
This is my time of the year<br>
This is my December<br>
This is all so clear<br>
This is my December<br>
This is my snow covered home<br>
This is my December<br>
This is me alone<br><br>

And I<br>
Just wish that I didn't feel<br>
Like there was something I missed<br>
And I<br>
Take back all the things that I said<br>
To make you feel like that<br>
And I<br>
Just wish that I didn't feel<br>
Like there was something I missed<br>
And I<br>
Take back all the things that I said to you.<br><br>

And I'd give it all away<br>
Just to have somewhere<br>
To go to<br>
Give it all away<br>
To have someone<br>
To come home to.<br><br>

I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard<br>
Handful of complaints but I can’t help the fact that everyone can see these scars<br>
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel<br>
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe this is real<br>
So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do<br>
Face away and pretend that I'm not<br>
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got<br><br>

[Chorus]<br>
I can't feel the way I did before<br>
Don't turn your back on me<br>
I won't be ignored<br>
Time won't heal this damage anymore<br>
Don't turn your back on me<br>
I won't be ignored<br><br>

I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident<br>
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make sense<br>
I am what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt<br>
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out<br>
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do<br>
Face away and pretend that I'm not<br>
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got<br><br>

[Chorus]<br>
I can't feel the way I did before<br>
Don't turn your back on me<br>
I won't be ignored<br>
Time won't heal this damage anymore<br>
Don't turn your back on me<br>
I won't be ignored<br><br>

Now<br>
Hear me out now<br>
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not<br>
Right now<br>
Hear me out now<br>
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not<br>
Right now<br><br>

I can't feel the way I did before<br>
Don't turn your back on me<br>
I won't be ignored<br><br>

[Chorus]<br>
I can't feel the way I did before<br>
Don't turn your back on me<br>
I won't be ignored<br>
Time won't heal this damage anymore<br>
Don't turn your back on me<br>
I won't be ignored<br><br>

I can't feel<br>
Don't turn your back on me<br>
I won't be ignored<br>
Time won't heal<br>
Don't turn your back on me<br>
I won't be ignored.<br><br></p></font>

Take me down to the river bend<br>
Take me down to the fighting end<br>
Wash the poison from off my skin<br>
Show me how to be whole again<br><br>

Fly me up on a silver wing<br>
Past the black where the sirens sing<br>
Warm me up in a nova's glow<br>
And drop me down to the dream below<br><br>

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass<br>
Hardly anything there for you to see<br>
For you to see<br><br>

Bring me home in a blinding dream,<br>
Through the secrets that I have seen<br>
Wash the sorrow from off my skin<br>
And show me how to be whole again<br><br>

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass<br>
Hardly anything there for you to see<br>
For you to see<br><br>

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass<br>
Hardly anything else I need to be<br><br>

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass<br>

For you to see<br>
