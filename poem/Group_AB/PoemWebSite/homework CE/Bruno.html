<h4> Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985), known professionally as Bruno Mars (/ˈmɑːrz/), is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and choreographer. Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, by a family of musicians, Mars began making music at a young age and performed in various musical venues in his hometown throughout his childhood. He graduated from high school and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career. After being dropped by Motown Records, Mars signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2009.

In 2009, he co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons, responsible for the singles "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B and "Billionaire" by Travie McCoy. He featured on the hooks for both singles, becoming recognized as a solo artist. His debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010) included the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles "Just the Way You Are" and "Grenade", as well as the number-four single "The Lazy Song". His second album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), peaked at number one in the United States. The album spawned the international singles "Locked Out of Heaven", "When I Was Your Man" and "Treasure". In 2014, Mars lent his vocals to Mark Ronson's "Uptown Funk". In 2016, he released his third studio album 24K Magic with the lead single of the same title released on October 7, 2016. To date, he has sold over 100 million singles and albums worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. Mars has landed six number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 since his career launched in 2010, attaining his first five faster than any male artist since Elvis Presley. </h4>

     Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin' <br>
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin' <br>
She's so beautiful <br>
And I tell her everyday <br>
<br>
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me <br>
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see <br>
But every time she asks me do I look okay? <br>
I say <br>
<br>
When I see your face <br>
There's not a thing that I would change <br>
'Cause you're amazing <br>
Just the way you are <br>
<br>
And when you smile <br>
The whole world stops and stares for awhile <br>
'Cause girl, you're amazing <br>
Just the way you are <br>
<br>
Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me <br>
Her laugh her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy <br>
She's so beautiful <br>
And I tell her everyday <br>
<br>
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change <br>
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same <br>
So don't even bother asking if you look okay <br>
You know I'll say <br>
<br>
When I see your face <br>
There's not a thing that I would change <br>
'Cause you're amazing <br>
Just the way you are <br>
<br>
And when you smile <br>
The whole world stops and stares for awhile<br> 
'Cause girl, you're amazing <br>
Just the way you are <br>
<br>
The way you are <br>
The way you are <br>
Girl, you're amazing <br>
Just the way you are <br>
<br>
When I see your face <br>
There's not a thing that I would change <br>
'Cause you're amazing <br>
Just the way you are <br>
<br>
And when you smile <br>
The whole world stops and stares for awhile <br>
'Cause girl, you're amazing <br>
Just the way you are, yeah<br>

<br> 
If you ever leave me, baby, <br>
Leave some morphine at my door <br>
Cause it would take a whole lot of medication<br> 
To realize what we used to have, <br>
We don't have it anymore. <br>
<br>
There's no religion that could save me <br>
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh <br>
So keep in mind all the sacrifices i'm making <br>
To keep you by my side <br>
And keep you from walking out the door. <br>
<br>
Cause there'll be no sunlight <br>
If I lose you, baby <br>
There'll be no clear skies <br>
If I lose you, baby <br>
Just like the clouds pass, <br>
I will do the same <br>
if you walk away <br>
Everyday, it will rain, <br>
<br>
I'll never be your mother's favorite <br>
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye <br>
Oooh if I was in their shoes,Ii'd be doing the same thing <br>
Saying there goes my little girl <br>
Walking with that troublesome guy. <br>
<br>
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand <br>
Oooh well little darling watch me change their minds <br>
Yeah for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try <br>
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding <br>
If that'll make it right. <br>

Ooooh don't just say <br>
Goodbye, don't just say, goodbye <br>
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding <br>
If that'll make it right. <br>
<br>
Cause there'll be no sunlight <br>
If I lose you, baby <br>
There'll be no clear skies <br>
If I lose you, baby <br>
Just like the clouds pass, <br>
I will do the same <br>
if you walk away <br>
Everyday, it will rain, <br>
Rain, rain.<br>

Verse 1 : <br>
<br>
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now <br>
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same <br>
When our friends talk about you all that it does is just tear me down <br>
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name <br>
And it all just sound like uh, uh, uh <br>
<br>
Chorus : <br>
<br>
Hmmm too young, too dumb to realize <br>
That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand <br>
Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance <br>
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance <br>
Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man. <br>
<br>
Verse 2 : <br>
<br>
My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways <br>
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life <br>
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made<br> 
And it hunts me every time I close my eyes <br>
It all just sounds like uh, uh, uh, uh <br>
<br><br>

Coda : <br>
<br>
Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong <br>
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late <br>
To try and apologize for my mistakes <br>
But I just want you to know <br>
I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hands<br> 
Give you all his hours when he has the chance <br>
Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance <br>
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man! <br>
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!<br>
