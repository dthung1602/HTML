<p style="font-family:palatino linotype;"><i>Pentatonix (often abbreviated as PTX) is an American a cappella group from Arlington, Texas, consisting of five vocalists:
 Avi Kaplan, Scott Hoying, Kirstin Maldonado, Kevin Olusola, and Mitch Grassi. Their work, which is mostly in the pop style, consists of covers of existing songs, 
sometimes in the form of medleys, along with their original material. Their music is defined by their own arrangement style, tight vocal harmonies, extensive vocal 
riffing, deep and steady vocal basslines, and a diverse range of vocal percussion and beatboxing.<br>
Pentatonix formed in 2011 and came to prominence the same year by winning the third season of The Sing-Off on NBC, their victory earning them $200,000 and a recording
 contract with Sony Music. After being dropped from Epic after The Sing-Off, the group formed its popular YouTube channel and distributed its music through Madison 
Gate Records, a small independent label owned by Sony Pictures that mainly distributes movie soundtracks. The group also makes effective use of social media to 
interact with its fan base.<br>
Having now eclipsed 11.5 million subscribers and more than 1.80 billion total views, Pentatonix's official YouTube channel is currently the 13th most subscribed music 
video channel and the 44th most subscribed channel overall, with their most viewed music video being a tribute to Daft Punk that has accumulated over 210 million views.<br>
Their debut EP PTX, Volume 1 was released in 2012, followed by their holiday release PTXmas the same year, with Pentatonix's third release, PTX, Vol. II, debuting at 
number 1 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart and number 10 on the Billboard 200 in 2013. In May 2014, Pentatonix signed with RCA Records, a "flagship" label of 
Sony Music Entertainment, while in the same year, the group released their fourth EP, PTX, Vol. III, and two full-length studio albums; PTX, Vols. 1 & 2, a 
compilation album released in Japan, Korea and Australia, and their second holiday release, That's Christmas to Me, with the album certified gold by the Recording 
Industry Association of America (RIAA), platinum on December 24, 2014, and double platinum on February 11, 2016, becoming the highest-charting holiday album by a group 
since 1962, and the fourth-best-selling album in the United States in 2014. The following year, Pentatonix released their eponymous album, their first 
consisting mostly of original material, which debuted atop the US Billboard 200 chart for the first time in their career, followed by a second Christmas album, A 
Pentatonix Christmas, the following year.<br>
Pentatonix, together with music producer and arranger Ben Bram, won the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella twice, first in 2015 for "Daft 
Punk" at the 57th Grammy Awards, and then again in 2016 for "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" at the 58th Grammy Awards; they are the only a capella artist to have won 
the award.<br>

<br>
Like the legend of the phoenix<br>
Our ends with beginnings<br>
What keep the planets spinning<br>
The force of love beginning<br>
<br>
We’ve come to far,<br>
To give up who we are<br>
So let’s raise the bar<br>
And our cups to the stars<br>
<br>
We’re up all night till the sun<br>
We’re up all night to get some<br>
We’re up all night for good fun<br>

(Ba-da-ba-ba-ba Ba-da-da Ooooh Ba-da-ba-ba-baaaa)<br>
<br>
Last night, I had this dream about you<br>
In this dream, I’m dancing right beside you<br>
There’s nothing wrong with just a little bit of fun<br>
We were dancing all night long<br>
<br>
Oh, I don’t know what to do<br>
About this dream and you<br>
I hope this dream comes true<br>
<br>
One more time<br>
We’re gonna celebrate<br>
Oh yeah, all right<br>
Don’t stop the dancing<br>
One more time<br>
We’re gonna celebra-a-a-a-a-ate<br>

Work it harder, make it better<br>

More than ever hour after<br>
Our work is never over<br>

It's so hard when people knock you down<br>
And tell you that you're never gonna get a shot at glory<br>
But that's when you rise to the challenge,<br>
Cause it's your time, your moment,<br> 
And nothing can't stop us now!<br>
<br>
What it is<br>
What it does<br>
What it is<br>
What it isn't<br>
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed<br>
Instead of getting on the internet and checking out who hit me, get up<br>
Thrift shop, pimp strut walking<br>
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious<br>
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby<br>
Sweater game nope nope y’all can’t copy<br>
Yup, Bad, moonwalking<br>
This here, is our party<br>
My posse's been on Broadway<br>
And we did it our way<br>
Throne music<br>
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it<br>
And yet I’m on<br>
Let that stage light go and shine on down<br>
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style<br>
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds<br>
But, I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town<br>
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N- T shit hustlin'<br>
Chasing dreams since I was 14<br>
With the four track bussing<br>
Halfway cross that city with the backpack<br>
Fat cat, crushing labels out here<br>
Nah they can’t tell me nothing<br>
We give that to the people<br>
Spread it across the country<br>
Labels out here<br>
Nah they can’t tell me nothing<br>
We give it to the people<br>
Spread it across the country<br>
<br>
[Hook- Ray Dalton]<br>
Here we go back, this is the moment<br>
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over<br>
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us<br>
Like the ceiling can’t hold us<br>
Here we go back, this is the moment<br>
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over<br>
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us<br>
Like the ceiling can’t hold us<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Now can I kick it, thank you<br>
Yeah I’m so damn grateful<br>
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts<br>
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you<br>
Y’all can’t stop me<br>
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat<br>
And I’m eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week<br>
Raw. Time to gone off. I'm gone!<br>
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome<br>
Ceasar will make you a believer<br>
Nah I never ever did it for a throne<br>
That validation comes from giving it back to the people.<br>
Nah sing a song and it goes like<br>
Raise those hands, this is our party<br>
We came here to live life like nobody was watching<br>
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me<br>
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves<br>
<br>

[Scott:]<br>
I've heard there was a secret chord<br>
That David played and it pleased the Lord<br>
But you don't really care for music, do ya?<br>
Well it goes like this<br>
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift<br>
The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
<br>
[Avi:]<br>
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya<br>
She tied you to the kitchen chair<br>
She broke your throne and she cut your hair<br>
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
<br>
[Kirstie:]<br>
Well baby I've been here before<br>
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor<br>
I used to live alone before I knew ya<br>
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch<br>
And love is not a vict'ry march<br>
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
<br>
[Mitch:]<br>
Well, maybe there's a God above<br>
But all I've ever learned from love<br>
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya<br>
And it's not a cry that you hear at night<br>
It's not somebody who's seen the light<br>
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
<br>
[All:]<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
