<p style="font-family:palatino linotype;"><i>Britney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, dancer and actress. Born in McComb, 
Mississippi, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child before signing with Jive Records in 
1997. Spears's first and second studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), became international successes, with the former 
becoming the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003), which yielded the worldwide 
success of the single "Toxic".<br> 
When Britney Spears was at the age of 17, she is still a very ordinary girl - a girl who likes fun and shopping, like reading romantic 
novels and enjoy peaceful days on the beach. But then her innocence and beauty comes from Kentwood, Louisiana has fascinated the world who listen to pop music with 
his debut album titled Britney Spears released by Jive Records.<br>
The album by the famous names Eric Foster White like (producer of Whitney Houston, Hi-Five) and Max Martin (producer of Robyn, Backstreet Boys, Ace of Base) and 
introduced a style very unexpected and very new Britney. The fans were soon singing Britney's charm from the sweet melody of My Broken From the Bottom of Heart to the 
lively rhythm of Baby One More Time and the powerful drum beat or song Soda Pop inspiring You've Got It All. Britney said: "I want to become a singer, but when anyone 
mentions, it is also envisioned a youthful and fun."<br>
Join concerts in local programs as well as in the church choir from a very young age, Britney auditioned club competition on the Disney channel's Mickey Mouse in 
Atlanta at 8 years old. 8-year-old is too young to be admitted to the club, but because no heart to miss a natural talent, producer program has sent Britney to New 
York to study at the Center for 3 years Off-Broadway Dance well English and the School of Performing Arts professional. So Britney began appearing in local shows and 
Broadway plays including Ruthless 1991 comedy based on The Bad Seed in 1956. Britney recalls: "At age 10 I was a kid though outwardly very naughty kid always proved 
docile. Back then it was fun! "<br>
Finally, also to the age of 11, Britney was old enough to participate in the Mickey Mouse Club. After two years of performing for one TV show filmed in the famous 
children Orlando, Britney returned to Kentwood to finish high school to age 14 years.<br>
As one fan of pop, Michael Jackson fans, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, Britney returned to New York to perform his music dream. She said: "I always wanted to be a 
singer, since he was a child I had dreamed of being a singer." At age 15, in the first audition to recruit girls to 1 girl group, Britney had the opportunity to 
develop a solo career of a pop singer also hired tutors continue to secondary school program notes. Britney confessed: "I am very poor geometry and Spanish."<br>
Even the spring of that year, Britney went to Sweden recording with Max Martin and then return to New Jersey to work with Foster White. At this point Britney was very 
willing to make a new mark worldwide. Britney said: "I would love to be expressed, is to feel people are listening to your music. I know I will have to sacrifice a lot 
of other things, but I would not give up their high school program. 2 years ago when I was at home all day, weekend outings and I always do the things familiar to 
boring. Now, everything was great because jobs here are my very favorite. "<br>
Britney was signed to Jive and oil in 1999 has released her debut album Baby One More Time. The album was successful, immediately jumped to the top of the album charts 
Pop. A lot of songs have achieved high rankings as Baby One More Time, (You Drive Me) Crazy From the Bottom of My and Broken Heart. Baby One More Time album soon 
became the best selling album ever by a teenage singer. Britney's success has created a movement of young beautiful female singers, notably Christina Aguilera and 
Jessica Simpson.<br>
Next, the spring of 2000, Britney released 2nd album Oops! ... I Did It again, and then the most recent album called Britney.<br> 
After a period of quiet with many unnecessary incidents happen in life (breakup with Justin Timberlake; put your middle finger up in front of the paparazzi; canceled 
show held in Mexico after having performed one time ...), the less one can doubt that Britney will be back and more surprised when she turned around drastically with 
4th album in the Zone.<br>
4th album Britney put her escape from the image of a pop princess adolescence, becoming a mature young woman and glamor. The album represents the first variation notes 
mature and surprisingly a Brit by the composer himself. Britney has partnered wrote 7 of the 12 songs with veteran names like Red Zone (in Me Against The Music and The 
Hook Up), The Matrix (the Shadow), Moby (in Early Morning) and Cathy Dennis (in Toxic and Showdown). Simultaneously with the contributions of the characters created 
hits such as R. Kelly (Outrageous) and Ying-Yang Twins (Boom Boom). And can not fail to mention the importance of the appearance of pop icon Madonna, who blew his 
vocals on the song single "Me Against The Music."<br> 
Combined with influential people timeless as Madonna is a realization of the dream came from Britney. "The work was beyond the capacity of the language expressed," the 
Brit said. Both have created a tight bond by during rehearsals for quite scandalous performances on the MTV Video Music Awards in the fall of 2003 (when Madonna kiss 
Britney Spears and gay for both Christina Aguilera when three people were performing on stage). "When we work together, sometimes I still do not believe I'm standing 
next to Madonna. That's what my dream was never dare to think."

Lately I been stuck imagining<br>
What I wanna do and what I really think,<br>
Time to blow out<br>
Be a little inappropriate<br>
'Cause I know that everybody's thinkin' it<br>
When the lights out<br>
<br>
Shame on me<br>
To need release<br>
Uncontrollably<br>
<br>
I wanna go all the way<br>
Taking out my freak tonight<br>
I wanna show<br>
All the dirt<br>
I got running through my mind<br>
<br>
Lately people got me all tied up<br>
There’s a countdown waiting for me to erupt<br>
Time to blow out<br>
I’ve been told who I should do it with<br>
To keep both my hands above the blanket<br>
When the lights out<br>
<br>
Shame on me<br>
To need release<br>
Uncontrollably<br>
<br>
I wanna go all the way<br>
Taking out my freak tonight<br>
I wanna show<br>
All the dirt<br>
I got running through my mind, whoa<br>
<br>
Shame on me (shame on me)<br>
To need release (to need release)<br>
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably)<br>
<br>
I wanna go, all the way<br>
Taking out my freak tonight<br>
I wanna show<br>
All the dirt<br>
I got running through my mind.

This is a story about a girl named Lucky…<br>
<br>
Early morning, she wakes up<br>
Knock, knock, knock on the door<br>
It's time for makeup, perfect smile<br>
It's you they're all waiting for<br>
They go…<br>
"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"<br>
And they say…<br>
<br>
She's so lucky, she's a star<br>
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking<br>
If there's nothing missing in my life<br>
Then why do these tears come at night<br>
<br>
Lost in an image, in a dream<br>
But there's no one there to wake her up<br>
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning<br>
But tell me what happens when it stops?<br>
They go…<br>
"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"<br>
And they say…<br>
<br>
"Best actress, and the winner is…Lucky!"<br>
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"<br>
"Oh my god…here she comes!"<br>
<br>
Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?<br>
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?<br>
If there's nothing missing in her life<br>
Why do tears come at night?<br>

Baby, can’t you see<br>
I’m calling<br>
A guy like you<br>
Should wear a warning<br>
It’s dangerous<br>
I’m fallin’<br>
<br>
There’s no escape<br>
I can’t wait<br>
I need a hit<br>
Baby, give me it<br>
You’re dangerous<br>
I’m lovin’ it<br>
<br>
Too high<br>
Can’t come down<br>
Losing my head<br>
Spinning ‘round and ‘round<br>
Do you feel me now<br>
<br>
With a taste of your lips<br>
I’m on a ride<br>
You're toxic I'm slipping under<br>
With a taste of a poison paradise<br>
I’m addicted to you<br>
Don’t you know that you’re toxic<br>
And I love what you do<br>
Don’t you know that you’re toxic<br>
<br>
It’s getting late<br>
To give you up<br>
I took a sip<br>
From my devil's cup<br>
Slowly<br>
It’s taking over me<br>
<br>
Too high<br>
Can’t come down<br>
It’s in the air<br>
And it’s all around<br>
Can you feel me now<br>
<br>
With a taste of your lips<br>
I’m on a ride<br>
You're toxic I'm slipping under<br>
With a taste of a poison paradise<br>
I’m addicted to you<br>
Don’t you know that you’re toxic<br>
And I love what you do<br>
Don’t you know that you’re toxic<br>
<br>
Don't you know that you're toxic<br>
<br>
With a taste of your lips<br>
I'm on a ride<br>
You're toxic I'm slipping under<br>
With a taste of a poison paradise<br>
I'm addicted to you<br>
Don't you know that you're toxic<br>
<br>
Intoxicate me now<br>
With your lovin' now<br>
I think I'm ready now<br>
I think I'm ready now<br>
Intoxicate me now<br>
With your lovin' now<br>
