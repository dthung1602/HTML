   <em>The Backstreet Boys (often abbreviated as BSB) are an American vocal group formed in Orlando, Florida <br>
   in 1993.The group consists of A. J. McLean, Howie D., Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson, and Brian Littrell.<br><br>
   The group rose to fame with their debut international album, Backstreet Boys (1996). In the following year<br>
   they released their second international album Backstreet's Back (1997), and their U.S. debut album which <br>
   continued the group's success worldwide. They rose to superstardom with their third studio album<br>
   Millennium (1999) and its follow-up album, Black & Blue (2000).<br> <br> 
   After a two-year hiatus, they regrouped and released a comeback album Never Gone (2005). After the conclusion<br>
   of the Never Gone Tour in 2006, Richardson left the group to pursue other interests. The group then released <br>
   two albums as a quartet: Unbreakable (2007) and This Is Us (2009).<br><br>
   In 2012, the group announced that Richardson had rejoined them permanently. In the following year they<br>
   celebrated their 20th anniversary and released their first independent album, In a World Like This (2013).<br>
   The group also released their first documentary movie, titled Backstreet Boys: Show 'Em What You're Made Of<br>
   in January 2015<br><br>
   The Backstreet Boys have sold over 140 million records worldwide, making them the  best-selling boy band <br>
   in history, and one of the world's best-selling music artists. They are the first group since Sade to have <br>
   their first nine albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, and the only boy band to do so. They also <br>
   received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 22, 2013.</em><br>

   <b>Lyrics</b></font></h1>
   <h3 align="left">
   Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine<br>
   I'm leavin' my life in your hands<br>
   People say I'm crazy and that I am blind<br>
   Risking it all in a glance<br>
   And how you got me blind is still a mystery<br>
   I can't get you out of my head<br>
   Don't care what is written in your history<br>
   As long as you're here with me<br><br>
   I don't care who you are<br>
   Where you're from<br>
   What you did<br>
   As long as you love me<br>
   Who you are<br>
   Where you're from<br>
   Don't care what you did<br>
   As long as you love me<br><br>
   Every little thing that you have said and done<br>
   Feels like it's deep within me<br>
   Doesn't really matter if you're on the run<br>
   It seems like we're meant to be<br>
   
   I don't care who you are (who you are)<br>
   Where you're from (where you're from)<br>
   What you did<br>
   As long as you love me (I don't know)<br>
   Who you are (who you are)<br>
   Where you're from (where you're from)<br>
   Don't care what you did<br>
   As long as you love me (yeah)<br><br>
   I've tried to hide it so that no one knows<br>
   But I guess it shows<br>
   When you look into my eyes<br>
   What you did and where you're comin from<br>
   I don't care, as long as you love me, baby<br><br>
   I don't care who you are (who you are)<br>
   Where you're from (where you're from)<br>
   What you did<br>
   As long as you love me (as long as you love me)<br>
   Who you are (who you are)<br>
   Where you're from (where you're from)<br>
   Don't care what you did (yeah)<br>
   As long as you love me (as long as you love me)<br>
   Who you are (who you are)<br>
   Where you're from<br>
   What you did<br>
   As long as you love me<br>
   Who you are (who you are)<br>
   Where you're from (where you're from)<br>
   As long as you love me<br>
   Who you are<br>
   As long as you love me<br>
   What you did (I don't care)<br>
   As long as you love me<br><br>

  <h3 align="left">
   Yeah<br><br>
   You are my fire <br>
   The one desire <br>
   Believe when I say <br>
   I want it that way <br><br>
   But we are two worlds apart <br>
   Can't reach to your heart <br>
   When you say <br>
   That I want it that way <br><br>
   [Chorus:] <br>
   Tell me why <br>
   Ain't nothin' but a heartache <br>
   Tell me why <br>
   Ain't nothin' but a mistake <br>
   Tell me why <br>
   I never wanna hear you say<br> 
   I want it that way <br><br>
   Am I your fire <br>
   Your one desire <br>
   Yes I know it's too late <br>
   But I want it that way <br><br>
   [Chorus] <br>
   Now I can see that we're falling apart <br>
   From the way that it used to be, yeah <br>
   No matter the distance <br>
   I want you to know <br>
   That deep down inside of me... <br><br>
   You are my fire <br>
   The one desire <br>
   You are <br>
   You are, you are, you are <br><br>
   Don't wanna hear you say <br>
   Ain't nothin' but a heartache <br>
   Ain't nothin' but a mistake<br> 
   (Don't wanna hear you say) <br>
   I never wanna hear you say <br>
   I want it that way <br><br>
   Tell me why <br>
   Ain't nothin' but a heartache <br>
   Tell me why <br>
   Ain't nothin but a mistake <br>
   Tell me why <br>
   I never wanna hear you say <br>
   (Don't wanna hear you say it) <br>
   I want it that way <br>
   I want it that way<br><br>

   <h3 align="left">
   Show me the meaning of being lonely<br>
   So many words for the broken heart<br>
   It's hard to see in a crimson love<br>
   So hard to breathe<br>
   Walk with me, and maybe<br>
   Nights of light so soon become<br>
   Wild and free I could feel the sun<br>
   Your every wish will be done<br>
   They tell me<br><br>
   [Chorus:]<br>
   Show me the meaning of being lonely<br>
   Is this the feeling I need to walk with<br>
   Tell me why I can't be there where you are<br>
   There's something missing in my heart<br><br>
   Life goes on as it never ends<br>
   Eyes of stone observe the trends<br>
   They never say forever gaze upon me<br>
   Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)<br>
   There's no control<br>
   Are you with me now?<br>
   Your every wish will be done<br>
   They tell me<br><br>
   [Chorus]<br>
   There's nowhere to run<br>
   I have no place to go<br>
   Surrender my heart, body, and soul<br>
   How can it be<br>
   You're asking me<br>
   To feel the things you never show<br><br>
   You are missing in my heart<br>
   Tell me why can't I be there where you are?<br><br>
