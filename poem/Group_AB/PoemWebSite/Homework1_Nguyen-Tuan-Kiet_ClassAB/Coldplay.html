   <em>Coldplay are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead vocalist and keyboardist Chris Martin and lead<br>
   guitarist Jonny Buckland at University College London (UCL). After they formed under the name Pectoralz<br>
   Guy Berryman joined the group as bassist and they changed their name to Starfish. Will Champion joined as <br>
   drummer and backing vocalist, completing the performing line-up. Creative  Director Phil Harvey is often<br>
   referred to as the official fifth member by the band. The band renamed themselves "Coldplay" in 1998, before <br>
   recording and releasing three EPs: Safety in 1998, Brothers & Sisters as a single in 1999, and The Blue <br>
   Room in the same year. The Blue Room was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.<br><br>
   They achieved worldwide fame with the release of the single "Yellow" in 2000. This was followed by their<br>
   debut album Parachutes released the same year, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize.The band's second <br>
   album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to critical acclaim and won multiple awards, including <br>
   NME's Album of the Year. Their next release, X&Y, the best-selling album worldwide in 2005, was met with <br>
   mostly positive reviews upon its release, though some critics felt that it was inferior to its predecessor.<br>
   The band's fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), was produced by Brian Eno <br>
   and released again to largely positive reviews, earning several Grammy Award nominations and wins at the 51st <br>
   Grammy Awards. On 24 October 2011, they released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which received mixed to <br>
   positive reviews, topped the charts in over 34 countries, and was the UK's best-selling rock album of 2011. <br>
   On 16 May 2014, they released their sixth album, titled Ghost Stories, which also received mixed to positive<br>
   reviews and topped  the iTunes Store albums charts in over 100 countries. On 4 December 2015, the band released<br>
   their seventh album, A Head Full of Dreams, which reached the top two in most major markets, but received <br>
   generally mixed reviews.<br><br>
