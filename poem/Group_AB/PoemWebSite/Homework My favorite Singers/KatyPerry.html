    <dd>Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer and songwriter. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.
Perry rose to fame in 2008 with the release of the singles "I Kissed a Girl"  which sparked controversy for its homosexual themes  and "Hot n Cold" from her second album, a pop rock record titled One of the Boys. Her third album, Teenage Dream (2010), ventured into disco, and contained the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles "California Gurls", "Teenage Dream", "Firework", "E.T.", and "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" as well as the number-three single "The One That Got Away". The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number-one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after Michael Jackson's album Bad. In March 2012, she re-issued the album as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which produced the songs "Part of Me" and "Wide Awake". Her fourth album, Prism, was released in 2013, and is influenced by pop and dance. She became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on Vevo with the videos for its songs "Roar" and "Dark Horse".
Perry has received many awards, including four Guinness World Records, and been included in the Forbes list of "Top-Earning Women In Music" (2011 to 2016). Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. She is one of the best-selling musical artists of all time, having sold 100 million records globally throughout her career. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013.

I won't just survive<br>
Oh, you will see me thrive<br>
Can't write my story<br>
I'm beyond the archetype<br>
<br>
I won't just conform<br>
No matter how you shake my core<br>
'Cause my roots they run deep, oh<br>
<br>
Oh, ye of so little faith<br>
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it<br>
Victory is in my veins<br>
I know it, I know it<br>
And I will not negotiate<br>
I'll fight it, I'll fight it<br>
I will transform<br>
<br>
When, when the fire's at my feet again<br>
And the vultures all start circling<br>
They're whispering, "You're out of time,"<br>
But still I rise<br>
<br>
This is no mistake, no accident<br>
When you think the final nail is in<br>
Think again<br>
Don't be surprised<br>
I will still rise<br>
<br>
I must stay conscious<br>
Through the madness and chaos<br>
So I call on my angels<br>
They say<br>
<br>
Oh, ye of so little faith<br>
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it<br>
Victory is in your veins<br>
You know it, you know it<br>
And you will not negotiate<br>
Just fight it, just fight it<br>
And be transformed<br>
<br>
'Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again<br>
And the vultures all start circling<br>
They're whispering, "You're out of time,"<br>
But still I rise<br>
<br>
This is no mistake, no accident<br>
When you think the final nail is in<br>
Think again<br>
Don't be surprised<br>
I will still rise<br>
<br>
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
You know it, you know it<br>
Still rise<br>
Just fight it, just fight it<br>
Don't be surprised<br>
I will still rise<br>

Summer after high school when we first met<br>
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead<br>
And on my 18th Birthday<br>
We got matching tattoos<br>
<br>
Used to steal your parents' liquor<br>
And climb to the roof<br>
Talk about our future<br>
Like we had a clue<br>
Never planned that one day<br>
I'd be losing you<br>
<br>
In another life<br>
I would be your girl<br>
We'd keep all our promises<br>
Be us against the world<br>
<br>
In another life<br>
I would make you stay<br>
So I don't have to say<br>
You were the one that got away<br>
The one that got away<br>
<br>
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash<br>
Never one without the other, we made a pact<br>
Sometimes when I miss you<br>
I put those records on (Whoa)<br>
<br>
Someone said you had your tattoo removed<br>
Saw you downtown singing the Blues<br>
It's time to face the music<br>
I'm no longer your muse<br>
<br>
But in another life<br>
I would be your girl<br>
We'd keep all our promises<br>
Be us against the world<br>
<br>
In another life<br>
I would make you stay<br>
So I don't have to say<br>
You were the one that got away<br>
The one that got away<br>
The o-o-o-o-o-one [x3]<br>
The one that got away<br>
<br>
[Bridge:]<br>
All this money can't buy me a time machine (Nooooo)<br>
Can't replace you with a million rings (Nooooo)<br>
I should've told you what you meant to me (Whoa)<br>
'Cause now I pay the price<br>
<br>
In another life<br>
I would be your girl<br>
We'd keep all our promises<br>
Be us against the world<br>
<br>
In another life<br>
I would make you stay<br>
So I don't have to say<br>
You were the one that got away<br>
The one that got away<br>
The o-o-o-o-o-one [x3]<br>
<br>
In another life<br>
I would make you stay<br>
So I don't have to say<br>
You were the one that got away<br>
The one that got away <br>

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag<br>
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?<br>
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin<br>
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?<br>
<br>
Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under?<br>
Screams but no one seems to hear a thing<br>
Do you know that there's still a chance for you<br>
'Cause there's a spark in you?<br>
<br>
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine<br>
Just own the night like the 4th of July<br>
<br>
'Cause, baby, you're a firework<br>
Come on, show 'em what you're worth<br>
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"<br>
As you shoot across the sky-y-y<br>
<br>
Baby, you're a firework<br>
Come on, let your colours burst<br>
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"<br>
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe<br>
<br>
You don't have to feel like a wasted space<br>
You're original, cannot be replaced<br>
If you only knew what the future holds<br>
After a hurricane comes a rainbow<br>
<br>
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed<br>
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road<br>
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow<br>
And when it's time you'll know<br>
<br>
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine<br>
Just own the night like the 4th of July<br>
<br>
'Cause, baby, you're a firework<br>
Come on, show 'em what you're worth<br>
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"<br>
As you shoot across the sky-y-y<br>
<br>
Baby, you're a firework<br>
Come on, let your colours burst<br>
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"<br>
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe<br>
<br>
Boom, boom, boom<br>
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon<br>
It's always been inside of you, you, you<br>
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough<br>
<br>
'Cause, baby, you're a firework<br>
Come on, show 'em what you're worth<br>
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"<br>
As you shoot across the sky-y-y<br>
<br>
Baby, you're a firework<br>
Come on, let your colours burst<br>
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"<br>
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe<br>
<br>
Boom, boom, boom<br>
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon<br>
Boom, boom, boom<br>
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon<br>
