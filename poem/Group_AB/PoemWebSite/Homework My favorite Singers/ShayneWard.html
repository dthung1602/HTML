    <dd>Shayne Thomas Ward (born 16 October 1984) is an English singer and actor, who rose to fame as the winner of the second series of The X Factor. His debut single, "That's My Goal", was released in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2005 and became the last number one of 2005 on the UK Singles Chart and that year's Christmas number one. It sold 313,000 copies on its first day of sales, making it the third fastest-selling single of all time in the UK, behind Elton John's "Candle in the Wind 1997" and Will Young's "Evergreen", which sold 685,000 and 400,000 copies in their first days of sale respectively.

Ward is the only X Factor winner to release an original song as his winner's single; all other winners have released a cover version. Ward's prize, as winner, was a recording contract with Simon Cowell's Syco record label, which is co-owned by Sony Music. The contract had a stated value of &#163;1 million, of which &#163;150,000 was a cash advance and the remainder was allocated to recording and marketing costs. His eponymous debut album was released in April 2006. It debuted at number one on both the Irish and UK Albums Charts, going 4&#42; Platinum in Ireland and Platinum in the UK. It also spawned two hit singles: "No Promises" and "Stand by Me". Follow-up album Breathless, featuring the top 10 hits "If That's OK with You" and "No U Hang Up", was released in November 2007 and topped the Irish charts, where it went 5&#42; Platinum, but only managed number two in the UK.

In November 2010, after a three-year hiatus, Ward released his third album, Obsession. In contrast to Shayne Ward and Breathless, however, it underperformed; with first-week sales of under 23,000, it missed the top 10 in both the UK and Ireland. In 2011, it was confirmed that Ward had been dropped by Syco after six years. Although he has yet to secure another record deal, in 2015 he released a new album Closer as an independent artist, funded through PledgeMusic.

On 18 December 2012, it was confirmed Ward would appear in Dancing on Ice which started on 6 January 2013. On 12 May 2015, it was announced that Ward had signed a one-year contract with ITV soap Coronation Street.

Hey baby, when we are together, doing things that we love.<br>

Baby life was good to me<br>
But you just made it better<br>
I love the way you stand by me<br>
Throught any kind of weather<br>
I don't wanna run away<br>
Just wanna make your day<br>
When you feel the world is on your shoulders<br>
Don't wanna make it worse<br>
Just wanna make us work<br>
Baby tell me I will do whatever<br>
<br>
It feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me<br>
Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me<br>
Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me<br>
Baby nobody, nobody, until you<br>
<br>
Baby it just took one hit of you now I'm addicted<br>
You never know what's missing<br>
Till you get everything you need, yeah<br>
I don't wanna run away<br>
Just wanna make your day<br>
When you feel the world is on your shoulders<br>
Don't wanna make it worse<br>
Just wanna make us work<br>
Baby tell me, I'll do whatever<br>
<br>
It feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me<br>
Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me<br>
Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me<br>
Baby, nobody, nobody until you<br>
<br>
See it was enough to know<br>
If I ever let you go<br>
I would be no one<br>
Cause I never thought I'd feel<br>
All the things you made me feel<br>
Wasn't looking for someone until you<br>
<br>
Nobody, nobody, until you<br>
Nobody, nobody, until you<br>

If our love was a fairy tale<br>
I would charge in and rescue you<br>
On a yacht baby we would sail<br>
To an island where we'd say I do<br>
<br>
And if we had babies they would look like you<br>
It'd be so beautiful if that came true<br>
You don't even know how very special you are<br>
<br>
You leave me breathless<br>
You're everything good in my life<br>
You leave me breathless<br>
I still can't believe that you're mine<br>
You just walked out of one of my dreams<br>
So beautiful you're leaving me<br>
Breathless<br>
<br>
And if our love was a story book<br>
We would meet on the very first page<br>
The last chapter would be about<br>
How I'm thankful for the life we've made<br>
<br>
And if we had babies they would have your eyes<br>
I would fall deeper watching you give life<br>
You don't even know how very special you are<br>
<br>
You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me<br>
You're like an angel<br>
The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me<br>
You're something special<br>
I only hope that I'll one day deserve what you've given me<br>
But all I can do is try<br>
Every day of my life<br>
