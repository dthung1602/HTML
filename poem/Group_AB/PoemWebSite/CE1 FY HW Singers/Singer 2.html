I'm run, yeah, oh yeah<br>
I'm run, yeah like my mind<br>
<br>
It's funny how I got just exactly what I want<br>
I'll try to have fun some other time<br>
I thought money was enough, it's just a temporary rush<br>
I'll try to go find some other high<br>
<br>
Don't know why I wanna make it even harder<br>
But I'm not the kind of man to take the easy road<br>
<br>
So much to do and not enough time<br>
Not enough time, oh I got<br>
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind<br>
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind<br>
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah<br>
I'm run, yeah like my mind<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that I'm not there to give you what you want<br>
I'll think about us some other time<br>
And I'm sorry that I can't be the perfect type of man<br>
I'll think about us some other time<br>

I'm only one call away<br>
I'll be there to save the day<br>
Superman got nothing on me<br>
I'm only one call away<br>

Call me, baby, if you need a friend<br>
I just wanna give you love<br>
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon<br>
Reaching out to you, so take a chance<br>

I'm gonna keep holding on<br>
Now don't you worry, it won't be long<br>
Darling, and when you feel like hope is gone<br>
Just run into my arms<br>

This is gonna hurt but I blame myself first, cause I ignored the truth<br>
Drunk off that love, it fucked my head up, there's no forgetting you<br>
You've awoken me, but you're choking me, I was so obsessed<br>
Gave you all of me, and now honestly I've got nothing left<br>
<br>
I loved you dangerously<br>
More than the air that I breathe<br>
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going<br>
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me<br>
Baby I loved you dangerously<br>
I loved you dangerously<br>
<br>
Usually I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back<br>
Look at how things change, cause now you're the train, and I'm tied to the track<br>
You've awoken me, but you're choking me, I was so obsessed<br>
Gave you all of me, and now honestly I've got nothing left<br>
<br>
Cause I loved you dangerously<br>
More than the air that I breathe<br>
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going<br>
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me<br>
Baby I loved you dangerously<br>
<br>
You took me down, down, down, down<br>
And kissed my lips with goodbye<br>
I see you now, now, now, now<br>
It was a matter of time
You know I know, there's only one place this could lead<br>
But you are the fire, I'm gasoline<br>
<br>
I love you, I love you, I love you, I loved you dangerously<br>
More than the air that I breathe<br>
Oh now, I knew we would crash at the speed that we were going<br>
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me<br>
Oh, oh baby I loved you dangerously<br>
<br>
Oh, I loved you dangerously<br>
Oh, oh, I loved you dangerously
