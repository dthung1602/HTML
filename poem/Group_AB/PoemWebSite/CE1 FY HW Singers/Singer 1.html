Once I was seven years old, my mama told me,<br>
"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely."<br>
Once I was seven years old<br>
<br>
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger<br>
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker<br>
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor<br>
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure<br>
<br>
Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me,<br>
"Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely."<br>
Once I was eleven years old<br>
<br>
I always had that dream, like my daddy before me<br>
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories<br>
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me<br>
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me<br>
<br>
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told<br>
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely<br>
Once I was twenty years old<br>
<br>
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure<br>
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major<br>
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor<br>
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later<br>
<br>
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told<br>
I was writing about everything I saw before me<br>
Once I was twenty years old<br>
<br>
Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold<br>
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming<br>
Soon we'll be thirty years old<br>
<br>
I'm still learning about life<br>
My woman brought children for me<br>
So I can sing them all my songs<br>
And I can tell them stories<br>
Most of my boys are with me<br>
Some are still out seeking glory<br>
And some I had to leave behind<br>
My brother, I'm still sorry<br>
<br>
Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one<br>
Remember life, and then your life becomes a better one<br>
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once<br>
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month<br>
<br>
Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold<br>
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?<br>
Soon I'll be sixty years old<br>
<br>
Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold<br>
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?<br>
Soon I'll be sixty years old<br>
<br>
Once I was seven years old, my mama told me,<br>
"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely."<br>
Once I was seven years old<br>
<br>
Once I was seven years old

When mama said that it was okay<br>
Mama said that it was quite alright<br>
Our kind of people had a bed for the night<br>
And it was OK<br>
Mama told us we are good kids<br>
And daddy told us never listen to the ones<br>
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun<br>
'Cause we were good kids<br>
<br>
Remember asking both my mom and dad<br>
Why we never traveled to exotic lands<br>
We only ever really visit friends<br>
Nothing to tell when the summer ends<br>
We never really went buying clothes<br>
Folks were passing on this stuff in plenty loads<br>
New shoes once a year and then<br>
Out to play ball so we could ruin them<br>
<br>
When mama said that it was okay<br>
Mama said that it was quite alright<br>
Our kind of people had a bed for the night<br>
And it was OK<br>
Mama told us we were good kids<br>
And daddy told us never listen to the ones<br>
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun<br>
'Cause we were good kids<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong I didn't have it bad<br>
I got enough loving from my mom and dad<br>
But I don't think they really understood<br>
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood<br>
I told them I'll be singing on TV<br>
The other kids were calling me a wannabe<br>
The older kids they started bugging me<br>
But now they're all standing right in front of me<br>
<br>
When mama said that it was okay<br>
Mama said that it was quite alright<br>
Our kind of people had a bed for the night<br>
And it was OK<br>
Mama told us we were good kids<br>
And daddy told us never listen to the ones<br>
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun<br>
'Cause we were good kids<br>
<br>
I know which place I'm from<br>
I know my home<br>
When I'm in doubt and struggling<br>
That's where I go<br>
An old friend can give advice<br>
When new friends only know a half story<br>
That's why I always keep them tight<br>
And why I'm okay<br>
I said I'm OK<br>
You know what my mama said<br>
You know what she told me<br>
<br>
My mama said that it was OK<br>
Mama said that it was quite alright<br>
Our kind of people had a bed for the night<br>
And it was OK<br>
Mama told us we were good kids<br>
And daddy told us never listen to the ones<br>
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun<br>
'Cause we were good kids<br>
<br>
Mama said that it was okay<br>
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba-ba,<br>
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba-ba,<br>
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba-ba<br>
When mama said that it was okay<br>
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba ba-ba,<br>

I only got you in my stories<br>
And you know I tell them right<br>
I remember you and I, when I'm awake at night<br>
So give it up for fallen glory<br>
I never got to say goodbye<br>
I wish I could ask for just a bit more time<br>
<br>
Every step I take, you used to lead the way<br>
Now I'm terrified to face it on my own<br>
<br>
You're not there<br>
To celebrate the man that you made<br>
You're not there<br>
To share in my success and mistakes<br>
Is it fair?<br>
You'll never know the person I'll be<br>
You're not there<br>
With me<br>
<br>
Though I know that you're not there<br>
I still write you all these songs<br>
It's like you got the right to know what's going on<br>
As I struggle to remember how you used to look and sound<br>
At times I still think I can spot you in the crowd<br>
<br>
Every step I take, you used to lead the way<br>
And now I'm terrified to face it on my own<br>
<br>
You're not there<br>
To celebrate the man that you made<br>
You're not there<br>
To share in my success and mistakes<br>
Is it fair?<br>
You'll never know the person I'll be<br>
You're not there<br>
With me<br>
<br>
Time can heal your wounds if you're strong and standing tall<br>
I've been doing all of that, it didn't help at all<br>
They say, "You'll grow older, and it'll get better still."<br>
Yes, I will, but no, it won't<br>
They don't get it, 'cause<br>
<br>
You're not there<br>
To celebrate the man that you made<br>
You're not there<br>
To share in my success and mistakes<br>
Is it fair?<br>
You'll never know the person I'll be<br>
You're not there<br>
With me
