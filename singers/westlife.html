    <h2 align="center"><b>Westlife</b></h2>
    <p ><b>Found: July 1998</b></p>
    <p><b>Origin: Sligo, Ireland</b></p>
    <p><b>Genres: Pop, blue eyed soul, pop rock, classical crossover</b></p>
    <p><b>Members: Nicky Byrne, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, Shane Filan, Brian McFadden</b></p>
        
    <p align="justify"> <font size="+3">T</font>he Westlife brief is simple. Make records. Then break them. The band holds the Guinness World Record as the most successful new chart act of all time, achieving seven consecutive Number 1s with their first seven singles.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"><font size="+2">W</font>estlife emerged from a six-piece band named IOU formed by Kian Egan, Mark Feehily and Shane Filan. While performing in a stage version of the musical Grease in Ireland, the boys were spotted by pop impresario Louis Walsh. On the look-out for the next Boyzone, Walsh took the boys on and groomed them as a hit-making machine. Immediately cut to three members, the band were initially called Westside, before changing to Westlife to avoid confusion, and possible legal problems, with a US group. With Nicky Byrne and Bryan McFadden joining the group, the first single - 'Swear It Again' - went straight to number one in 1999, followed by 'If I Let You Go' and 'Flying Without Wings'.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"><font size="+2">B</font>efore long the band had secured their place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the only band to have topped the charts seven times in a row. The records have kept coming ever since - in every sense. Sell-out tours, albums and DVDs have helped keep the awards rolling in with two Brit awards, an MTV Europe award and two Record of the Year awards, among many others.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"><font size="+2">I</font>n March 2004, Bryan left the band to pursue a solo career and, despite critics predicting the end of the road, the group's popularity hasn't been affected. Their album, 'Allow Us To Be Frank' is a collection of the band's favourite classics from the golden Rat Pack era. In 2005, the group released their 'Face to Face' album, which shot to the top of the charts and earned Westlife a Record of the Year award for the track 'You Raise Me Up'. Westlife signed a new five-album deal the following year and released their eighth album, 'The Love Album'.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"><font size="+2">T</font>he hard-working group released their ninth album, 'Back Home', in 2007. It reached number one in the charts and became one of the best-selling albums of the year. In 2008, the group marked their tenth year in the music industry with a sold-out concert at Croke Park in Dublin, which 83,000 fans attended. The same year, they were declared Ireland's ninth richest celebrities aged under 30 and 13th in general. As a band they were worth 36 million Euros. They made a surprise appearance on 'The X-Factor' and performed 'Flying Without Wings' with JLS on 13 December 2008. Westlife took a one-year break following their anniversary concert and released their tenth album, 'Where We Are' in November 2009.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"><font size="+2">I</font>n 2010, the group released their eleventh studio album, 'Gravity'. 'Safe', the first single released from the album, reached number ten in the UK charts. On 14 March 2011, the band announced they had left Simon Cowell after 13 years due to his decision not to release a second single from the their most recent album. Byrne expanded and stated that Cowell had been great in 1998 but the development of 'American Idol' and 'The X-Factor' had left the band feeling "unloved".</p>
    
    <p align="justify"><font size="+2">O</font>n 19 October 2011, Westlife announced they would be releasing their second greatest hits album on 21 November 2011. They also revealed that their nine-date tour in 2012 would be a farewell tour as they will be splitting up.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"><font size="+2">I</font>n a statement, the band said: "The decision is entirely amicable and after spending all of our adult life together so far, we want to have a well-earned break and look at new ventures."</p>

 An empty street, an empty house
 A hole inside my heart
 I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller.
 
 I wonder how, I wonder why,
 I wonder where they are
 The days we had, 
 The songs we sang together, oh, yeah.
 
 And all my love, I'm holding on forever
 Reaching for the love that seems so far
 
 [Chorus:]
 So I say a little prayer
 And hope my dreams will take me there
 Where the skies are blue 
 to see you once again, my love.
 Over seas from coast to coast
 To find the place I love the most
 Where the fields are green 
 to see you once again, my love.
 
 I try to read, I go to work
 I'm laughing with my friends
 But I can't stop 
 to keep myself from thinking, oh, no.
 
 I wonder how, I wonder why,
 I wonder where they are
 The days we had, 
 the songs we sang together, oh, yeah.
 
 And all my love, I'm holding on forever
 Reaching for the love that seems so far
 
 [Chorus:]
 So I say a little prayer
 And hope my dreams will take me there
 Where the skies are blue
 to see you once again, my love.
 Over seas from coast to coast
 To find the place I love the most
 Where the fields are green 
 to see you once again,
 
 To hold you in my arms,
 To promise you my love,
 To tell you from the heart,
 You're all I'm thinking of.
 
 Reaching for the love that seems so far
 
 [Chorus:]
 So I say a little prayer
 And hope my dreams will take me there
 Where the skies are blue 
 to see you once again, my love.
 Over seas from coast to coast
 To find the place I love the most
 Where the fields are green 
 to see you once again, my love.
 
 [Chorus:]
 Say a little prayer (my sweet love)
 Dreams will take me there
 Where the skies are blue (woah, yeah) 
 to see you once again, my love. (oh, my love)
 Over seas from coast to coast
 To find the place I love the most
 Where the fields are green 
 to see you once again, my love.

 [Kian:]
 Goodbye to you, my trusted friend
 We've known each other since we were nine or ten
 Together we've climbed hills and trees
 Learned of love and ABC's
 Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
 
 [Bryan:]
 Goodbye, my friend, it's hard to die
 When all the birds are singing in the sky
 Now that spring is in the air
 Pretty girls are everywhere
 Think of me and I'll be there
 
 [All:]
 We had joy, we had fun, 
 we had seasons in the sun
 But the hills that we climbed 
 were just seasons out of time
 
 [Shane:]
 Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me
 I was the black sheep of the family
 You tried to teach me right from wrong
 Too much wine and too much song
 Wonder how I got along
 
 [Mark:]
 Goodbye, Papa, it's hard to die
 When all the birds are singing in the sky
 Now that the spring is in the air
 Little children everywhere
 When you see them I'll be there
 
 [All:]
 We had joy, we had fun, 
 we had seasons in the sun
 But the wine and the song 
 like the seasons have all gone
 We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
 But the wine and the song 
 like the seasons have all gone
 
 [Nicky:]
 Goodbye, Michelle, my little one
 You gave me love and helped me find the sun
 And every time that I was down
 You would always come around
 And get my feet back on the ground
 
 [Shane:]
 Goodbye, Michelle, it's hard to die
 When all the birds are singing in the sky
 Now that the spring is in the air
 With the flowers everywhere
 I wish that we could both be there
 
 [All:]
 We had joy, we had fun, 
 we had seasons in the sun
 But the hills that we climbed 
 were just seasons out of time
 We had joy, we had fun, 
 we had seasons in the sun
 But the wine and the song 
 like the seasons have all gone
 We had joy, we had fun, 
 we had seasons in the sun
 But the wine and the song 
 like the seasons have all gone
 We had joy, we had fun, 
 we had seasons in the sun
 But the wine and the song like
 the seasons have all gone
