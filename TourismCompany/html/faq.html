            <h2>Flights FAQ's</h2>
            
            <h4><a name="q1.1">How do I change my flights?</a></h4>
            <p align="justify">We have negotiated many different types of agreements with different airlines; thus, the rules and restrictions for exchanges and cancellations vary greatly if allowed at all. When allowed, airlines require that we collect a fee for the exchange plus any difference in fare when necessary. Exchange fees start at $125 USD and go as high as $350 USD. Your exchange agent can tell you when you call.</p>

            <p align="justify">We must insist, however, that you do not book an itinerary for the exchange. Please keep in mind that all exchanges must be on itineraries provided by the same airline that issued the original ticket. In some cases, the airline may restrict or deny exchanges requested with as few as seven days before departure.</p>

            <p align="justify">Once you are prepared to give our exchange agent the new itinerary, please call us at (866) 883-0908. We are open 24/7. To expedite this process, please have your old ticket and/or file number with you as well as the new itinerary you wish to book.</p>

            
            <h4><a name="q1.2">How do I cancel this reservation?</a></h4>
            <p align="justify">Most airline tickets issued are non-refundable, and non-transferable. Name changes are not permitted. However, you may be able to exchange your tickets for different dates. Penalty fees apply and not all tickets are changeable. Please call our exchange department for details. (866) 883-0908</p>
           
            <h4><a name="q1.3">Can I change the name on my ticket?</a></h4>
            <p align="justify">All reservations must be made in the EXACT name of the person traveling - no nicknames. For international travel the name on the reservation must be EXACTLY as it appears on the traveler's passport. </p>

            <h2>Billing & Payments</h2>
            
            <h4><a name="q2.1">When can I expect my refund?</a></h4>
            <p align="justify">When a reservation is cancelled the same day it was booked, funds for the Airline portion are not collected. Any pending charges you may have seen would have been a "pending hold" for verification. These funds will return to your available credit and will not reflect as a refund. This process normally takes from 3 - 7 business days, depending on your banking institutions procedures.</p>

            <p align="justify">Please note: Some Prepaid credit card companies will hold pending authorizations for up to 30 days.</p>

            <p align="justify">If the airline rules allow for cancellation the day after booking, funds for the Airline portion will be refunded within 7 - 14 business days. It will depend upon the Airline(s) and your banking institutions policies. At times the refund will post before the charge is processed or may not appear on your current statement. Please contact your bank to verify the refund was received. </p>

            <p align="justify">Any refunds requested after 48-hours of purchase are based solely upon the Airline(s) rules. If approved, the refund will generally take 1-2 billing statement cycles. In some exceptional cases refunds may take longer than originally anticipated. An email update will be sent to you advising of any delay. </p>
            
            <h4><a name="q2.2">I received an email advising of a refund I did not request.</a></h4>
            <p align="justify">These refunds are typically for seat assignment requests that could not be fulfilled by the Airline or during a quality check if we detected an overcharge. This refund does not affect your airline ticket purchase.</p>
           
            <h4><a name="q2.3">I have multiple charges on my account</a></h4>
            <p align="justify">This occurs when multiple Airlines or passengers are booked in a reservation. You will see a charge for each ticket processed separately. Any service fees, taxes or additional services may also show as separate charges with the description of Airline/Taxes and Fees. When added together these amounts should total the amount you were quoted.</p>

            <h2>Hotel FAQ's</h2>
            
            <h4><a name="q3.1">Can I add additional people to an existing hotel booking?</a></h4>
            <p align="justify">Yes. You can add a guest to the same hotel room by calling our customer service desk at (866) 883-0908. Please note there may be a charge for additional guests. </p>

            <p align="justify">If you need to book an additional room for the guest you may do so online as a new reservation.</p>
            
            <h4><a name="q3.2">Can I cancel or make changes to my hotel booking?</a></h4>
            <p align="justify">Many pre-paid hotels are non refundable and cannot be cancelled or changed. There is a cancellation fee of $35 USD charged by OneTravel com. You may also be subject to penalties and fees from the hotel. OneTravel.com advises you to verify all hotel rules on your pre-paid reservation.</p>
           
            <h4><a name="q3.3">When will I be charged for my hotel reservation?</a></h4>
            <p align="justify">If you have reserved an Exclusive (pre-paid) hotel reservation, your credit card will be charged at the time of booking and includes most taxes and fees. Any additional costs such as meals, laundry, telephone and parking and resort fee's are not included in your reservation rate.</p> 

            <p align="justify">For non Exclusive rates payment is made at the time of check-out. Some hotels require a one night deposit charged at the time of booking. Local and state taxes, fees and any additional costs incurred by you are not included in the quoted rate unless stated.</p>
