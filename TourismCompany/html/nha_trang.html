                <p align="justify">Loud and proud (say it!), the high-rise, high-energy beach resort of Nha Trang enjoys a stunning setting: ringed by a necklace of hills, with a sweeping crescent beach, the city's turquoise bay is dotted with tropical islands.</p>
                <p align="justify">The shoreline has had a huge makeover in recent years, with quiet parks and sculpture gardens spread along the impressive promenade, while the streets inland reveal quirky boutiques and a cosmopolitan array of dining options.</p>
                <p align="justify">As restaurants wind down, nightlife cranks up - central Nha Trang is a party town at heart, like any self-respecting resort should be. Most of it is aimed directly at the many Russian and Chinese tourists. Forget the curfews of the capital; visitors play late in this town.</p>
                <p align="justify">There are more sedate activities on offer too. The beachfront has quiet, open bars. Or try an old-school spa treatment with a visit to a mudbath or explore centuries-old Cham towers still standing in the town centre.</p>

            <h2>Long Son Pagoda</h2>
            <p align="justify">Climb steep steps for this striking pagoda, founded in the late 19th century. The entrance and roofs are decorated with mosaic dragons constructed of glass and ceramic tile while the main sanctuary is a hall adorned with modern interpretations of traditional motifs.</p>
            <p align="justify">Behind the pagoda is a huge white Buddha seated on a lotus blossom. Around the statue's base are fire-ringed relief busts of Thich Quang Duc and six other Buddhist monks who died in self-immolations in 1963.</p>
            <p align="justify">The platform around the 14m-high Buddha has great views of Nha Trang and nearby rural areas. As you approach the pagoda from the street, the 152 stone steps up the hill to the Buddha begin to the right of the structure. Take some time to explore off to the left, where there's an entrance to another hall of the pagoda.</p>
            <p align="justify">Beggars congregate within the complex, as do a number of scam artists. There's a persistent scam here, where visitors are approached by children (and adults) with preprinted name badges claiming to work for the monks. After showing you around the pagoda, whether invited to or not, they will then demand money 'for the monks' or 'for a prayer'. If that fails, they insist that you buy postcards for 200,000d. The best course of action is to ignore them when they first appear, if they persist, tell them you're not going to give them any money. If you do want to make a contribution towards the upkeep of the complex, leave it in the donation boxes as you would in any other pagoda.</p>
            <p align="justify">The pagoda is located about 400m west of the train station, just off 23 Thang 10.</p>

            <h2>National Oceanographic Museum</h2>
            <p align="justify">Housed in a grand French-colonial building in the port district of Cau Da at the far south end of Nha Trang, this drab museum has 60,000 or so jars of pickled marine specimens, stuffed birds and sea mammals, and displays of local boats and fishing artefacts. There are tanks with fascinating reef fish (and sharks), three rescued seals kept here (not for entertainment) and a whale skeleton. Refreshingly nonglitzy, the displays focus on environmental education, with good English descriptions, rather than tourism.</p>

            <h2>Po Nagar Cham Towers</h2>
            <p align="justify">Built between the 7th and 12th centuries, these four Cham Towers are still actively used for worship by Cham, Chinese and Vietnamese Buddhists. Originally the complex had seven or eight towers, but only four remain, of which the 28m-high North Tower (Thap Chinh), which dates from AD 817, with its terraced pyramidal roof, vaulted interior masonry and vestibule, is the most magnificent.</p>
            <p align="justify">The towers stand on a granite knoll 2km north of central Nha Trang, on the banks of the Cai River.</p>
            <p align="justify">It's thought this site was first used for worship as early as the 2nd century AD. The original wooden structure was razed to the ground by attacking Javanese in AD 774, but was replaced by a stone-and-brick temple (the first of its kind) in 784.</p>
            <p align="justify">The towers serve as the Holy See, honouring Yang Ino Po Nagar, the goddess of the Dua (Liu) clan, which ruled over the southern part of the Cham kingdom. There are inscribed stone slabs scattered throughout the complex, most of which relate to history or religion and provide insight into the spiritual life and social structure of the Cham.</p>
            <p align="justify">All the temples face east, as did the original entrance to the complex, which is to the right as you ascend the hillock. In centuries past, worshippers passed through the pillared meditation hall, 10 pillars of which can still be seen, before proceeding up the steep staircase to the towers.</p>
            <p align="justify">In 918, King Indravarman III placed a gold mukha-linga (carved phallus with a human face painted on it) in the North Tower, but it was taken by Khmer raiders. This pattern of statues being destroyed or stolen and then replaced continued until 965, when King Jaya Indravarman IV replaced the gold mukha-linga with the stone figure, Uma (Shakti, or female consort of Shiva), which remains to this day.</p>
            <p align="justify">Above the entrance to the North Tower, two musicians, one of whose feet is on the head of the bull Nandin, flank a dancing four-armed Shiva. The sandstone doorposts are covered with inscriptions, as are parts of the walls of the vestibule. A gong and a drum stand under the pyramid-shaped ceiling of the antechamber. In the 28m-high pyramidal main chamber, there is a black-stone statue of the goddess Uma with 10 arms, two of which are hidden under her vest; she is seated and leaning back against a monstrous beast.</p>
            <p align="justify">The Central Tower (Thap Nam) was built partly of recycled bricks in the 12th century on the site of a structure dating from the 7th century. It is less finely constructed than the other towers and has little ornamentation; the pyramidal roof lacks terracing or pilasters, although the interior altars were once covered with silver. There is alinga inside the main chamber.</p>
            <p align="justify">The South Tower (Mieu Dong Nam), at one time dedicated to Sandhaka (Shiva), still shelters a linga, while the richly ornamented Northwest Tower (Thap Tay Bac) was originally dedicated to Ganesh. To the rear of the complex is a less-impressive museum with a few examples of Cham stonework.</p>
            <p align="justify">To get here from central Nha Trang, take Ð Quang Trung (which becomes Ð 2 Thang 4) north across the Ha Ra and Xom Bong Bridges. Po Nagar can also be reached via the Tran Phu Bridge along the beachfront road.</p>
            <p align="justify">This site has a continuing religious significance, so be sure to remove your shoes before entering.</p>
