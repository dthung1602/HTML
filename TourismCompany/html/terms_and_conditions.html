            <h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>
            <pre>
The following terms and conditions apply if you are joining one of our regularly scheduled trips listed in our 
catalog or on our website*.If you are joining a private journey, please click here for the terms and conditions
unique to private journeys.

Deposit Payments

A deposit of $300 per person, per tour is required to confirm a reservation (with the exception of India and 
Zambia where the deposit is $600 per person). This may be paid with a Visa, MasterCard, American Express or 
personal check. (Please note that if you are also joining us on one of our extensions to a tour, there is an 
additional deposit of $300 per person for the extension. This is applicable to all regularly scheduled extensions
with the exception of India, where the extension deposit is $600 per person.)

Confirmation Package

As soon as we receive your reservation and deposit, we will send you detailed information on what to bring,
how to prepare for your trip, travel directions, detailed itinerary, trip cancellation insurance application,
pre- and post-tour hotel information and Savitar Travel' policies.

Balance Payments

The balance of the trip price is due 60 days prior to departure, payable by check or credit card. If 
you pay your deposit by credit card, we will assume that you would like your balance also paid by credit
card and we will charge your card for the balance due 60 days prior to departure, unless you instruct us 
otherwise in writing. If the balance is not paid when due, Savitar Travel reserves the right to regard 
the reservation as canceled.

Cancellations and Refunds

If you must cancel your reservation for a tour and/or its extension, we will refund your deposit, less the
following fees per tour and/or extension:

Days Prior to Trip Start Date 	Trip Cancellation Fee Per Person
        91+ days 	                          $50
        61-90 days 	                          $300
        46-60 days 	                    50% of trip price
        31-45 days 	                    75% of trip price
        0-30 days 	                    100% of trip price
        
When you cancel a trip, we must ask you to notify us in writing. Exceptions to these policies cannot
be made for any reason. We are also happy to assist you in transferring from one trip to another in 
the same calendar year up to 70 days prior to the trip date at no charge, after which our 
cancellation policy applies. If unforeseen circumstances require a change to the trip itinerary, 
Savitar Travel will make every effort to select alternative hotels of the same standard and to keep 
modifications to a minimum. Savitar Travel reserves the right to cancel a trip for any reason. 
In such an instance, we will refund all payments received, which will constitute full settlement.


Arrival and Departure

Each trip begins and ends in a town accessible by plane, train, boat or bus. Meeting and ending 
locations are listed on each of the individual trip pages in the catalog, as well as in your 
pre-departure information. For some tours, it may be preferable to arrive at the starting point 
the night prior to the trip departure date. We will be happy to provide you with instructions on 
how to phone or fax the hotels yourself, or to make these reservations for you. If you elect to 
have Savitar Travel make these reservations for you, the hotels require that we provide them with
a credit card number to hold these reservations or, in rare occasions, to send them a check in 
advance of arrival. We will advise you of specific hotel payment policies.

Accommodations

Trip prices are based on two people per room. If you are traveling alone, we will assign you a 
roommate of the same gender, or you can choose to room alone, paying the single supplement. There
are a limited number of single rooms available on all trips. If you choose to be paired with a 
roommate and we are unable to pair you, we will invoice you for the single supplement 60 days 
prior to the trip. If we are subsequently able to find you a roommate, we will gladly refund the 
single supplement.

Insurance

We include in all Deposit and Final Confirmation Packages an application form for short-term travel
insurance that offers you options to cover baggage, accident/ life and/or trip cancellation. Trip 
cancellation insurance reimburses you for non-refundable air and land costs, if you have to cancel 
a trip due to personal or family illness or accident. The insurance that we recommend also provides
coverage for all pre-existing conditions if you complete your insurance form and postmark it within
seven calendar days of our receipt of your deposit. We highly recommend that you obtain this insurance.

We suggest Travel Guard International, as it is America's leading travel insurance company protecting
more than 4 million travelers each year. There are two ways to purchase your insurance from Travel 
Guard. The fastest and easiest way is to purchase your insurance on-line by clicking the Travel 
Guard link after you have completed your reservation with Savitar Travel. The link will take you 
directly to the Travel Guard web site, where in minutes you can be insured in full for your trip with
us. Travel Guard will send you an insurance certificate. If you prefer to wait for your deposit 
confirmation package from us, we'll include with it Travel Guard's insurance application. Please 
keep in mind that Travel Guard makes additional benefits available to you if you take out the 
insurance within 15* days of making your reservation with us.

*For guests who live in Washington state or Oregon, TravelGuard must be purchased within 7 days 
to receive these additional benefits.
