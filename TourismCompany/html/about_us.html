            <h1>7 reasons for choosing us</h1>
            <h4>1. SAVVY</h4>

            <p align="justify">You're wedged in the back seat of a rickshaw in the midst of a massive traffic jam (5 donkey carts, a pre-WWI truck with a broken axle, a red motorbike piled high with crates stuffed full of chickens, and a small boy herding a flock of distressed geese!), you've left your wallet and cell phone in your other jacket pocket, your coach leaves in 6 mins, everyone around is arguing in the Min-Don qu dialect (a language you didn't major in at Uni) and your stomach is starting to have second thoughts about that fish head soup you had for lunch. What do you do?</p>
            <p>Relax!</p>
            <p align="justify">We've been there a million times – OK, that's a slight exaggeration, but you get the point!</p>
            <p align="justify">What we're trying to say is... why learn the hard way when you can tap into the specialist, in-depth knowledge of Savitar Travel's friendly consultants and travel guides.</p>

            <h5>The right advice for you</h5>
            <p align="justify">We'll give you professional, independent and unbiased advice. We'll show you all the options, put forward our best recommendations, clarify fine print and help tailor a travel solution to suit you perfectly. Because we keep our finger on the pulse, we have first access to new travel deals, discounts and other competitive information. With Savitar Travel, getting the right advice and making travel decisions is so much easier!</p>

            <h5>Insider info</h5>
            <p align="justify">Take advantage of Savitar Travel's first hand knowledge of the journey ahead. We'll let you in on all the best tips and tricks, do's and don't's, travel restrictions, local laws and regulations, what to avoid and things you simply shouldn't miss! You won't find this sort of info on a Google search or the back of a brochure. And if you join one of our Personally Escorted Small Group Tours, we'll be right there with you, providing expert guidance at all times!</p>
            <h4>2. METICULOUS</h4>
            <p align="justify">As you embark on your journey it's comforting to know that Savitar Travel has every last detail sorted. We put in the hard yards to plan, organise and implement every aspect of your travel. From international flight connections... to sightseeing recommendations... to correct documentation at every turn... to ensuring local customs are respected.

We offer more choice, personal service and we'll keep you informed at all times. By taking care of the small details Savitar Travel gives you more freedom to appreciate the grand vista.</p>
            <h4>3. SANITY</h4>

            <p align="justify">Saving yours, that is. Thankfully we've also managed to keep a hold of ours too! Let's face it, arranging travel and touring unknown countries can be very stressful at times. By making use of Savitar Travel's services you'll save yourself the headache and the heartache many people suffer when trying to do it all themselves. After all, it's our job to know which way's up in any situation around the world. We can save you from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>complex terms and conditions</li>
                <li>taking the wrong turn</li>
                <li>travel scams, shady deals and rip-offs</li>
                <li>inflated prices or being short changed</li>
                <li>pitfalls that snare the innocent</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>1001 things that will erode your time, energy and bank balance</p>
            <p></p>Let Savitar Travel take all the hard work and pain out of your travel requirements, so you can just relax and enjoy the journey!</p>
            <h4>4. CLOUT (WHEN IT'S NEEDED)</h4>
            <p align="justify">Over the 15+ years we've been in business we've become extremely adept at solving travel problems. As a TAANZ bonded, IATA Accredited Travel Agency, Savitar Travel has more clout than you do as an individual when dealing with airlines, hotels and other travel providers. If there's an issue, you can easily contact us and we'll be on the case straight away, getting it sorted quickly for you. It's just another way we can make your journey much less stressful.</p>
            <h4>5. FUN</h4>
            <p align="justify">“I'm picking up good vibrations!” as the Beach Boys used to croon. Ask anyone who's been on one of our tours and you'll discover that laughter is our constant companion. The whole Savitar Travel team endeavour to make your travel experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. Andrew's jokes and John's impromptu slap-stick routines may be as bad as ever, but a smile, a friendly word and a positive vibe are never far away. It's not unknown for our tour guests to return to NZ feeling 20 years younger (a good enough reason in itself to book that tour right now!).</p>
            <h4>6. FRIENDSHIP</h4>
            <p align="justify">Travelling without sharing the experience with someone else is like going to a great movie on your own – that special bond is missing! Imagine then, how it feels to share your journey with likeminded people and to make new friends along the way! This is the beauty of Savitar Travel's Personally Escorted Small Group Tours. Guests love the camaraderie of travelling with others, appreciating their similarities (and differences), exchanging stories and enjoying the fascination of the journey together. Our tours have sparked many lasting friendships for both T2U staff and our guests (and even the odd romance!), with numerous guests returning year after year to join other tours. Our famous pre and post tour gatherings provide a wonderful opportunity to mingle and celebrate our exciting adventures.</p>
            <h4>7. TEAM</h4>
            <p align="justify">Right from that very first friendly greeting on the phone our aim is to make you feel welcome at Savitar Travel. We are justifiably proud of the reputation our team has earned over the years in building friendship and trust with our valued clientèle. Our professional travel consultants respect and seek to truly understand your unique needs and desires. We are a tight knit bunch that pull together to provide you with the best service and the sharpest deals! Our hard working Personally Escorted Small Group Tour Directors lead by example (literally) as they inspire, care for and guide our tour guests to the far flung reaches of the world.</p>

            <p align="justify">Our wider team includes key partners, such as world renowned Singapore Airlines who provide uncompromising service across the globe, and Royal Balloon, our preferred provider of Hot Air Balloon flights in Cappadocia. Savitar Travel has built a strong and large network of industry professionals, including airlines, cruise and coach tour operators, hotels and local tour guides. We've also established great friendships with some niche service providers, like Suat who owns the fascinating and captivating Castle Inn hotel in Turkey. Tell him Savitar Travel sent you and be treated like royalty! Backed by our energetic team here in New Zealand our partners all play an important role in making sure that you have the time of your life!</p>
